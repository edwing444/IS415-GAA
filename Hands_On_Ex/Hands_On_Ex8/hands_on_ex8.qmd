## **12.8 Spatially Constrained Clustering: SKATER approach**

In this section, you will learn how to derive spatially constrained cluster by using [*skater()*](https://r-spatial.github.io/spdep/reference/skater.html) method of [**spdep**](https://r-spatial.github.io/spdep/index.html) package.

### **12.8.1 Converting into SpatialPolygonsDataFrame**

First, we need to convert `shan_sf` into SpatialPolygonsDataFrame. This is because SKATER function only support **sp** objects such as SpatialPolygonDataFrame.

The code chunk below uses [*as_Spatial()*](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/reference/coerce-methods.html) of **sf** package to convert *shan_sf* into a SpatialPolygonDataFrame called *shan_sp*.

```{r}
shan_sp <- as_Spatial(shan_sf)
```

### **12.8.2 Computing Neighbour List**

Next, [poly2nd()](https://r-spatial.github.io/spdep/reference/poly2nb.html) of **spdep** package will be used to compute the neighbours list from polygon list.

```{r}
shan.nb <- poly2nb(shan_sp)
summary(shan.nb)
```

We can plot the neighbours list on shan_sp by using the code chunk below. Since we now can plot the community area boundaries as well, we plot this graph on top of the map. The first plot command gives the boundaries. This is followed by the plot of the neighbor list object, with coordinates applied to the original SpatialPolygonDataFrame (Shan state township boundaries) to extract the centroids of the polygons. These are used as the nodes for the graph representation. We also set the color to blue and specify add=TRUE to plot the network on top of the boundaries.

```{r}
coords <- st_coordinates(
  st_centroid(st_geometry(shan_sf)))
```

```{r}
plot(st_geometry(shan_sf), 
     border=grey(.5))
plot(shan.nb,
     coords, 
     col="blue", 
     add=TRUE)
```

Note that if you plot the network first and then the boundaries, some of the areas will be clipped. This is because the plotting area is determined by the characteristics of the first plot. In this example, because the boundary map extends further than the graph, we plot it first.

### **12.8.3 Computing minimum spanning tree**

#### 12.8.3.1 Calculating edge costs

Next, [*nbcosts()*](https://r-spatial.github.io/spdep/reference/nbcosts.html) of **spdep** package is used to compute the cost of each edge. It is the distance between it nodes. This function compute this distance using a data.frame with observations vector in each node.

The code chunk below is used to compute the cost of each edge.

```{r}
lcosts <- nbcosts(shan.nb, shan_ict)
```

For each observation, this gives the pairwise dissimilarity between its values on the five variables and the values for the neighbouring observation (from the neighbour list). Basically, this is the notion of a generalised weight for a spatial weights matrix.

Next, We will incorporate these costs into a weights object in the same way as we did in the calculation of inverse of distance weights. In other words, we convert the neighbour list to a list weights object by specifying the just computed ***lcosts*** as the weights.

In order to achieve this, [*nb2listw()*](https://r-spatial.github.io/spdep/reference/nb2listw.html) of **spdep** package is used as shown in the code chunk below.

Note that we specify the *style* as **B** to make sure the cost values are not row-standardised.

```{r}
shan.w <- nb2listw(shan.nb, 
                   lcosts, 
                   style="B")
summary(shan.w)
```

### **12.8.4 Computing minimum spanning tree**

The minimum spanning tree is computed by mean of the [*mstree()*](https://r-spatial.github.io/spdep/reference/mstree.html) of **spdep** package as shown in the code chunk below.

```{r}
shan.mst <- mstree(shan.w)
```

After computing the MST, we can check its class and dimension by using the code chunk below.

```{r}
class(shan.mst)
```

```{r}
dim(shan.mst)
```

Note that the dimension is 54 and not 55. This is because the minimum spanning tree consists on n-1 edges (links) in order to traverse all the nodes.

We can display the content of *shan.mst* by using *head()* as shown in the code chunk below.

```{r}
head(shan.mst)
```

The plot method for the MST include a way to show the observation numbers of the nodes in addition to the edge. As before, we plot this together with the township boundaries. We can see how the initial neighbour list is simplified to just one edge connecting each of the nodes, while passing through all the nodes.

```{r}
plot(st_geometry(shan_sf), 
                 border=gray(.5))
plot.mst(shan.mst, 
         coords, 
         col="blue", 
         cex.lab=0.7, 
         cex.circles=0.005, 
         add=TRUE)
```

### **12.8.5 Computing spatially constrained clusters using SKATER method**

The code chunk below compute the spatially constrained cluster using [*skater()*](https://r-spatial.github.io/spdep/reference/skater.html) of **spdep** package.

```{r}
clust6 <- spdep::skater(edges = shan.mst[,1:2], 
                 data = shan_ict, 
                 method = "euclidean", 
                 ncuts = 5)
```

The *skater()* takes three mandatory arguments: - the first two columns of the MST matrix (i.e.Â not the cost), - the data matrix (to update the costs as units are being grouped), and - the number of cuts. Note: It is set to **one less than the number of clusters**. So, the value specified is **not** the number of clusters, but the number of cuts in the graph, one less than the number of clusters.

The result of the *skater()* is an object of class **skater**. We can examine its contents by using the code chunk below.

```{r}
str(clust6)
```

The most interesting component of this list structure is the groups vector containing the labels of the cluster to which each observation belongs (as before, the label itself is arbitary). This is followed by a detailed summary for each of the clusters in the edges.groups list. Sum of squares measures are given as ssto for the total and ssw to show the effect of each of the cuts on the overall criterion.

We can check the cluster assignment by using the conde chunk below.

```{r}
ccs6 <- clust6$groups
ccs6
```

We can find out how many observations are in each cluster by means of the table command. Parenthetially, we can also find this as the dimension of each vector in the lists contained in edges.groups. For example, the first list has node with dimension 12, which is also the number of observations in the first cluster.

```{r}
table(ccs6)
```

Lastly, we can also plot the pruned tree that shows the five clusters on top of the townshop area.

```{r}
plot(st_geometry(shan_sf), 
     border=gray(.5))
plot(clust6, 
     coords, 
     cex.lab=.7,
     groups.colors=c("red","green","blue", "brown", "pink"),
     cex.circles=0.005, 
     add=TRUE)
```

### **12.8.6 Visualising the clusters in choropleth map**

The code chunk below is used to plot the newly derived clusters by using SKATER method.

```{r}
groups_mat <- as.matrix(clust6$groups)
shan_sf_spatialcluster <- cbind(shan_sf_cluster, as.factor(groups_mat)) %>%
  rename(`SP_CLUSTER`=`as.factor.groups_mat.`)
qtm(shan_sf_spatialcluster, "SP_CLUSTER")
```

For easy comparison, it will be better to place both the hierarchical clustering and spatially constrained hierarchical clustering maps next to each other.

```{r}
hclust.map <- qtm(shan_sf_cluster,
                  "CLUSTER") + 
  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) 

shclust.map <- qtm(shan_sf_spatialcluster,
                   "SP_CLUSTER") + 
  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) 

tmap_arrange(hclust.map, shclust.map,
             asp=NA, ncol=2)
```

## **12.9 Spatially Constrained Clustering: ClustGeo Method**

In this section, you will gain hands-on experience on using functions provided by **ClustGeo** package to perform non-spatially constrained hierarchical cluster analysis and spatially constrained cluster analysis.

### **12.9.1 A short note about ClustGeo package**

[**ClustGeo**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ClustGeo/) package is an R package specially designed to support the need of performing spatially constrained cluster analysis. More specifically, it provides a Ward-like hierarchical clustering algorithm called `hclustgeo()` including spatial/geographical constraints.

In the nutshell, the algorithm uses two dissimilarity matrices D0 and D1 along with a mixing parameter alpha, whereby the value of alpha must be a real number between \[0, 1\]. D0 can be non-Euclidean and the weights of the observations can be non-uniform. It gives the dissimilarities in the **attribute/clustering variable space**. D1, on the other hand, gives the dissimilarities in the **constraint space**. The criterion minimised at each stage is a convex combination of the homogeneity criterion calculated with D0 and the homogeneity criterion calculated with D1.

The idea is then to determine a value of alpha which increases the spatial contiguity without deteriorating too much the quality of the solution based on the variables of interest. This need is supported by a function called `choicealpha()`.

### **12.9.2 Ward-like hierarchical clustering: ClustGeo**

ClustGeo package provides function called `hclustgeo()` to perform a typical Ward-like hierarchical clustering just like `hclust()` you learned in previous section.

To perform non-spatially constrained hierarchical clustering, we only need to provide the function a dissimilarity matrix as shown in the code chunk below.

```{r}
nongeo_cluster <- hclustgeo(proxmat)
plot(nongeo_cluster, cex = 0.5)
rect.hclust(nongeo_cluster, 
            k = 6, 
            border = 2:5)
```

Note that the dissimilarity matrix must be an object of class `dist`, i.e.Â an object obtained with the function `dist()`. For sample code chunk, please refer to [5.7.6 Computing proximity matrix](https://r4gdsa.netlify.app/chap05#computing-proximity-matrix)

#### 12.9.2.1 Mapping the clusters formed

Similarly, we can plot the clusters on a categorical area shaded map by using the steps we learned in 5.7.12 Mapping the clusters formed.

```{r}
groups <- as.factor(cutree(nongeo_cluster, k=6))
```

```{r}
shan_sf_ngeo_cluster <- cbind(shan_sf, as.matrix(groups)) %>%
  rename(`CLUSTER` = `as.matrix.groups.`)
```

```{r}
qtm(shan_sf_ngeo_cluster, "CLUSTER")
```
