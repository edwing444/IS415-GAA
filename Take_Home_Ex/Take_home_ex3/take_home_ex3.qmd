# Reading data

1.  **`boundary_data`**: This object loads the **administrative boundary data** for Vietnam from a geospatial source file, specifically for the **first administrative level** (likely provinces). The data will enable geographic plotting and spatial analyses of provinces across Vietnam. The `st_read` function from the `sf` package is used here to load this shapefile, making it suitable for spatial analysis tasks such as mapping or integrating spatial features with aspatial data.

2.  **PCI Data (`PCI_2012_data` to `PCI_2022_data`)**: These objects load **Provincial Competitiveness Index (PCI) data** for Vietnam for each year from **2012 to 2022**. Each CSV file contains aspatial (non-geographic) data that likely includes indicators of economic performance, governance quality, business environment, and investment appeal at the provincial level. By reading the data for each year separately, it prepares for a time-series analysis of PCI metrics across provinces, allowing insights into trends or patterns in competitiveness and governance over time.

This setup aims to combine spatial and aspatial data for a comprehensive analysis of Vietnam’s provincial competitiveness over a decade.

```{r}
# Import administrative boundary data for vietnam
boundary_data <- st_read(dsn="data/geospatial",
                         layer = "vnm_admbnda_adm1_gov_20201027")
```

# Cleaning data

This code refines the **administrative boundary data** by performing two main actions:

1.  **Selecting and Dropping Columns**: It removes several unnecessary columns from `boundary_data`, including administrative codes, alternative names, and validity dates, to keep only essential information. This reduces the dataset size and complexity, making it more manageable and focused on what is likely required for analysis.

2.  **Renaming a Column**: It renames the `ADM1_EN` column to `province`. This renaming enhances readability, making it clearer that this column represents the **province name** in English.

Overall, these changes prepare the `boundary_data` for integration with other datasets (like the PCI data), focusing only on necessary columns for analysis.

```{r}
boundary_data <- boundary_data %>%
  dplyr::select(-ADM1_VI,-ADM1_REF,-ADM1ALT1EN,-ADM1ALT2EN,-ADM1ALT1VI,-ADM1ALT2EN, -ADM1ALT2VI, -ADM0_VI,-ADM0_EN,-ADM0_PCODE,-date,-validOn,-validTo,-ADM1_PCODE) %>% 
  rename(province = ADM1_EN) %>% 
  mutate(province = recode(province,"Ba Ria - Vung Tau" = "BRVT",
         "Thua Thien Hue" = "TT-Hue",
         "Ho Chi Minh city" = "HCMC",
         "Can Tho city" = "Can Tho",
         "Da Nang city" = "Da Nang",
         "Hai Phong city" = "Hai Phong"))

```

```{r}
write_rds(boundary_data,'data/rds/boundary_data.rds')
```

These codes processes the **PCI data for 2012-2022** by:

1.  **Dropping Unnecessary Columns**: It removes various unnamed columns (`X`, `X.1`, `X.2`, etc.) and the `No` column, which may contain indices or irrelevant data. These columns might have been automatically generated during data export or are not needed for analysis.

2.  **Renaming the Province Column**: The column `Province` is renamed to `province` to match the column name in `boundary_data`. Consistently naming this key column across datasets enables smoother data merging or joining, especially when linking the PCI data with the spatial boundary data.

This preparation step ensures the PCI data is streamlined and ready for integration with other datasets in the analysis.

# Joining data

This code joins the **spatial boundary data** and **PCI data for 2012-2022** by:

1.  **Merging Data**: The `left_join` function merges `boundary_data` with PCI data using the `province` column as a common key. This results in a new PCI dataset that includes spatial information (geometry) from `boundary_data` along with the PCI indicators for 2012-2022. The `left_join` ensures that all records from `boundary_data` are kept, and matching rows from PCI data are added.

2.  **Removing Rows with Missing Data**: `drop_na` removes any rows with `NA` values from PCI data, likely to ensure that only provinces with complete PCI data and spatial information are retained for further analysis. This prevents issues that could arise from missing values during analysis or visualization.

This approach creates a complete dataset with both spatial and PCI data for 2012-2022, facilitating spatial analysis and mapping of competitiveness indicators across Vietnamese provinces.

# Preparing and Computing Data for Global Moran I

This code prepares a **spatial weights matrix** using **Queen contiguity** to model spatial relationships between provinces in the PCI dataset:

1.  **Calculate Centroids**: `st_centroid(st_geometry(PCI_2012_data))` computes the centroids of each province's polygon. While centroids aren't directly needed for creating a contiguity matrix, they can be useful for visualizations or other analyses.

2.  **Create Neighbor List Using Queen Contiguity**: `poly2nb(PCI_2012_data, queen = TRUE)` establishes a **neighbors list** where provinces sharing a border are considered neighbors (Queen contiguity). This approach is inclusive, considering any shared edge or corner between polygons as a connection.

3.  **Convert to Spatial Weights List**: `nb2listw(nb_global_2012, style = "W")` transforms the neighbors list (`nb_global_2012`) into a **spatial weights matrix** (`lw_global_2012`). The `style = "W"` parameter row-standardizes the weights, meaning each row sums to 1, providing relative influence among neighbors and helping avoid scale issues in spatial analysis.

This setup is crucial for spatial econometric models and for analyzing spatial autocorrelation, as it defines how each province relates to its neighbors.

::: panel-tabset
## 2012

```{r}
# Step 1: Create spatial weights matrix (Queen Contiguity)
coords_global_2012 <- st_centroid(st_geometry(PCI_2012_data)) # Use centroids of polygons
nb_global_2012 <- poly2nb(PCI_2012_data, queen = TRUE) # Create neighbors list using queen contiguity
lw_global_2012 <- nb2listw(nb_global_2012, style = "W") # Convert to weights list (row-standardized)
```

```{r}
#covert to numeric for PCI 2012
PCI_2012_data$PCI.2012 <- as.numeric(PCI_2012_data$PCI.2012)
# Step 2: Compute Global Moran's I
global_moran_2012 <- moran.test(PCI_2012_data$PCI.2012, lw_global_2012)
# Step 3: Print the results
print(global_moran_2012)
```

1.  **Moran's I statistic**: The Moran's I statistic is 0.0807, a positive value indicating weak positive spatial autocorrelation. This suggests that locations with similar PCI Scores in 2012 show a slight tendency to cluster geographically, but the effect is minimal.

2.  **Expectation**: The expected value of Moran's I under the null hypothesis of no spatial autocorrelation is -0.0175, which reflects what would be expected in a random spatial pattern.

3.  **Variance**: The variance of the Moran's I statistic is 0.00860, which helps in assessing the significance of the observed Moran's I.

4.  **Standard deviate (Z-score)**: The Z-score of 1.0588 indicates that the observed Moran's I statistic is about 1.06 standard deviations above the expected value under the null hypothesis. This suggests a slight presence of spatial clustering, though not substantial.

5.  **p-value**: The p-value is 0.1448, which is higher than the conventional significance level of 0.05, meaning that the result is not statistically significant.

### Conclusion:

The Moran's I test for 2012 indicates weak positive spatial autocorrelation, but with a p-value of 0.1448, the result is not statistically significant. This suggests that there is insufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis of no spatial autocorrelation. Therefore, the slight clustering of similar PCI Scores in 2012 is not strong enough to be considered statistically significant.

## 2013

```{r}
# Step 1: Create spatial weights matrix (Queen Contiguity)
coords_global_2013 <- st_centroid(st_geometry(PCI_2013_data)) # Use centroids of polygons
nb_global_2013 <- poly2nb(PCI_2013_data, queen = TRUE) # Create neighbors list using queen contiguity
lw_global_2013 <- nb2listw(nb_global_2013, style = "W") # Convert to weights list (row-standardized
```

```{r}
#covert to numeric for PCI 2013
PCI_2013_data$PCI.2013 <- as.numeric(PCI_2013_data$PCI.2013)
# Step 2: Compute Global Moran's I
global_moran_2013 <- moran.test(PCI_2013_data$PCI.2013, lw_global_2013)
# Step 3: Print the results
print(global_moran_2013)
```

1.  **Moran's I statistic**: The Moran's I statistic is 0.0152, which is very close to zero, indicating an almost random spatial distribution of PCI Scores in 2013. This suggests little to no spatial autocorrelation, meaning that similar PCI Scores are not clustered geographically in any significant way.

2.  **Expectation**: The expected value of Moran's I under the null hypothesis of no spatial autocorrelation is -0.0179, consistent with what would be seen in a random spatial pattern.

3.  **Variance**: The variance of the Moran's I statistic is 0.0090, which is used to assess the statistical significance of the observed Moran's I value.

4.  **Standard deviate (Z-score)**: The Z-score of 0.3486 indicates that the observed Moran's I is close to the expected value under the null hypothesis, further suggesting little to no spatial clustering.

5.  **p-value**: The p-value is 0.3637, which is considerably above the common significance level of 0.05. This indicates that the result is not statistically significant.

### Conclusion:

The Moran's I test for 2013 shows no significant spatial autocorrelation, as indicated by the near-zero Moran's I statistic and a high p-value (0.3637). This suggests there is no evidence to reject the null hypothesis of no spatial autocorrelation, meaning PCI Scores in 2013 are distributed in a largely random pattern without meaningful geographic clustering.

## 2014

```{r}
# Step 1: Create spatial weights matrix (Queen Contiguity)
coords_global_2014 <- st_centroid(st_geometry(PCI_2014_data)) # Use centroids of polygons
nb_global_2014 <- poly2nb(PCI_2014_data, queen = TRUE) # Create neighbors list using queen contiguity
lw_global_2014 <- nb2listw(nb_global_2014, style = "W") # Convert to weights list (row-standardized
```

```{r}

# Step 2: Compute Global Moran's I
global_moran_2014 <- moran.test(PCI_2014_data$PCI.2014, lw_global_2014)
# Step 3: Print the results
print(global_moran_2014)
```

1.  **Moran's I statistic**: The Moran's I statistic is 0.0952, a positive value indicating weak positive spatial autocorrelation. This suggests a slight tendency for areas with similar PCI Scores in 2014 to be clustered geographically, though the effect is minimal.

2.  **Expectation**: The expected value of Moran's I under the null hypothesis of no spatial autocorrelation is -0.0175, which would align with a random spatial pattern.

3.  **Variance**: The variance of the Moran's I statistic is 0.00849, which helps in determining the significance of the observed Moran's I value.

4.  **Standard deviate (Z-score)**: The Z-score of 1.2237 indicates that the observed Moran's I statistic is about 1.22 standard deviations above the expected value, suggesting a slight presence of spatial clustering.

5.  **p-value**: The p-value is 0.1105, which is above the standard significance level of 0.05, indicating that the result is not statistically significant.

### Conclusion:

The Moran's I test for 2014 shows weak positive spatial autocorrelation, but with a p-value of 0.1105, this result is not statistically significant. Therefore, there is insufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis of no spatial autocorrelation, meaning that any clustering of similar PCI Scores in 2014 is weak and not statistically meaningful.

## 2015

global_moran_2016 <- moran.test(PCI_2016_data$PCI.2016, lw_global_2016)
# Step 3: Print the results
print(global_moran_2016)
```

1.  **Moran's I statistic**: The Moran's I statistic is 0.0287, which is close to zero, indicating an almost random spatial distribution of PCI Scores in 2016. This suggests little to no spatial autocorrelation, meaning there is no meaningful geographic clustering of similar scores.

2.  **Expectation**: The expected value of Moran's I under the null hypothesis of no spatial autocorrelation is -0.0175, consistent with what would be expected for a random spatial pattern.

3.  **Variance**: The variance of the Moran's I statistic is 0.00815, which is used to evaluate the statistical significance of the observed Moran's I value.

4.  **Standard deviate (Z-score)**: The Z-score of 0.5123 shows that the observed Moran's I statistic is close to the expected value under the null hypothesis, indicating a lack of spatial clustering.

5.  **p-value**: The p-value is 0.3042, which is much higher than the standard significance threshold of 0.05. This indicates that the result is not statistically significant.

### Conclusion:

The Moran's I test for 2016 suggests no significant spatial autocorrelation, as indicated by the near-zero Moran's I statistic and a high p-value (0.3042). This lack of statistical significance means there is no evidence to reject the null hypothesis of no spatial autocorrelation. Therefore, PCI Scores in 2016 are distributed in a largely random pattern without significant geographic clustering.

# Step 3: Print the results
print(global_moran_2017)
```

1.  **Moran's I statistic**: The Moran's I statistic is 0.0782, indicating a weak positive spatial autocorrelation. This suggests a slight tendency for similar PCI Scores in 2017 to be geographically clustered, though the effect is minimal.

2.  **Expectation**: The expected value of Moran's I under the null hypothesis of no spatial autocorrelation is -0.0175, which would correspond to a random spatial distribution.

3.  **Variance**: The variance of the Moran's I statistic is 0.00848, which assists in evaluating the statistical significance of the observed Moran's I value.

4.  **Standard deviate (Z-score)**: The Z-score of 1.0397 indicates that the observed Moran's I is just over one standard deviation above the expected value under the null hypothesis, suggesting slight clustering.

5.  **p-value**: The p-value is 0.1492, which is higher than the typical significance level of 0.05, indicating that the result is not statistically significant.

### Conclusion:

The Moran's I test for 2017 shows weak positive spatial autocorrelation, but with a p-value of 0.1492, this result is not statistically significant. Therefore, there is insufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis of no spatial autocorrelation, suggesting that any clustering of similar PCI Scores in 2017 is minimal and not statistically meaningful.

```

1.  **Moran's I statistic**: The Moran's I statistic is 0.1093, a positive value indicating weak positive spatial autocorrelation. This suggests that locations with similar Weighted PCI Scores in 2018 tend to be slightly clustered geographically, but the effect is not strong.

2.  **Expectation**: The expected value of Moran's I under the null hypothesis of no spatial autocorrelation is -0.0175, which reflects random spatial patterns.

3.  **Variance**: The variance of the Moran's I statistic is 0.00837, which is used to assess the statistical significance of the observed Moran's I.

4.  **Standard deviate (Z-score)**: The Z-score of 1.3862 indicates that the observed Moran's I statistic is about 1.39 standard deviations above the expected value under the null hypothesis. This suggests a mild presence of spatial clustering, but not strongly so.

5.  **p-value**: The p-value is 0.08284, which is greater than the common significance level of 0.05. This indicates that the spatial autocorrelation is not statistically significant.

### Conclusion:

The Moran's I test for 2018 shows weak positive spatial autocorrelation, but the p-value (0.08284) suggests that this result is not statistically significant at the 5% level. There is insufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis of no spatial autocorrelation. Therefore, while there is a slight tendency for areas with similar PCI Scores in 2018 to cluster geographically, this pattern is not strong enough to be considered statistically significant.

```

1.  **Moran's I statistic**: The Moran's I statistic is 0.0757, a positive value, suggesting weak positive spatial autocorrelation. This means that locations with similar Weighted PCI Scores in 2019 show a slight tendency to cluster geographically, but the correlation is quite weak.

2.  **Expectation**: The expected value of Moran's I under the null hypothesis of no spatial autocorrelation is -0.0175, which is typical for random spatial distributions.

3.  **Variance**: The variance of the Moran's I statistic is 0.00842, used to assess the statistical significance of the observed Moran's I.

4.  **Standard deviate (Z-score)**: The Z-score of 1.0163 indicates that the observed Moran's I statistic is about 1 standard deviation higher than what would be expected under the null hypothesis. This suggests a very mild degree of spatial clustering.

5.  **p-value**: The p-value is 0.1547, which is greater than the common significance level of 0.05. This means the result is not statistically significant.

### Conclusion:

The Moran's I test for 2019 shows weak positive spatial autocorrelation, but the result is not statistically significant (p-value = 0.1547). There is insufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis of no spatial autocorrelation. Therefore, the slight tendency for areas with similar PCI Scores in 2019 to cluster geographically is not strong enough to be considered statistically significant.

## 2020

```{r}
# Step 1: Create spatial weights matrix (Queen Contiguity)
coords_global_2020 <- st_centroid(st_geometry(PCI_2020_data)) # Use centroids of polygons
nb_global_2020 <- poly2nb(PCI_2020_data, queen = TRUE) # Create neighbors list using queen contiguity
lw_global_2020 <- nb2listw(nb_global_2020, style = "W") # Convert to weights list (row-standardized
```

```{r}
#covert to numeric for PCI 2020
PCI_2020_data$The.Weighted.PCI.Score <- as.numeric(PCI_2020_data$The.Weighted.PCI.Score)
# Step 2: Compute Global Moran's I
global_moran_2020 <- moran.test(PCI_2020_data$The.Weighted.PCI.Score, lw_global_2020)
# Step 3: Print the results
print(global_moran_2020)
```

1.  **Moran's I statistic**: The Moran's I statistic is 0.1278, which is a positive value, suggesting some positive spatial autocorrelation. This means that locations with similar Weighted PCI Scores in 2020 tend to be geographically closer to one another, but the correlation is relatively weak.

2.  **Expectation**: The expected value of Moran's I under the null hypothesis of no spatial autocorrelation is -0.0175. This reflects a random spatial distribution.

3.  **Variance**: The variance of Moran's I statistic under randomization is 0.00803, which helps to determine the significance of the observed Moran's I value.

4.  **Standard deviate (Z-score)**: The Z-score of 1.622 indicates that the observed Moran's I statistic is about 1.62 standard deviations above the expected value under the null hypothesis. This suggests some presence of spatial clustering but not very strong.

5.  **p-value**: The p-value is 0.0524, which is slightly above the typical significance threshold of 0.05. While this result is close to being statistically significant, it does not reach conventional levels of significance.

### Conclusion:

The Moran's I test for 2020 suggests weak positive spatial autocorrelation, but the p-value (0.0524) indicates that it is not quite statistically significant at the 5% level. Although there is a mild tendency for areas with similar PCI Scores in 2020 to cluster geographically, the evidence is not strong enough to confidently reject the null hypothesis of no spatial autocorrelation. This result is on the borderline of significance.

## 2021

```{r}
# Step 1: Create spatial weights matrix (Queen Contiguity)
coords_global_2021 <- st_centroid(st_geometry(PCI_2021_data)) # Use centroids of polygons
nb_global_2021 <- poly2nb(PCI_2021_data, queen = TRUE) # Create neighbors list using queen contiguity
lw_global_2021 <- nb2listw(nb_global_2021, style = "W") # Convert to weights list (row-standardized
```

```{r}
#covert to numeric for PCI 2021
PCI_2021_data$The.Weighted.PCI.Score <- as.numeric(PCI_2021_data$The.Weighted.PCI.Score)
# Step 2: Compute Global Moran's I
global_moran_2021 <- moran.test(PCI_2021_data$The.Weighted.PCI.Score, lw_global_2021)
# Step 3: Print the results
print(global_moran_2021)
```

1.  **Moran's I statistic**: The Moran's I statistic is 0.1722, a positive value indicating moderate positive spatial autocorrelation. This suggests that locations with similar Weighted PCI Scores in 2021 tend to be geographically clustered.

2.  **Expectation**: The expected value of Moran's I under the null hypothesis of no spatial autocorrelation is -0.0175, which reflects a random spatial pattern.

3.  **Variance**: The variance of the Moran's I statistic is 0.00851, used in determining the significance of the observed Moran's I.

4.  **Standard deviate (Z-score)**: The Z-score of 2.0572 indicates that the observed Moran's I statistic is about 2.06 standard deviations above the expected value under the null hypothesis. This suggests a noticeable degree of spatial clustering.

5.  **p-value**: The p-value is 0.01984, which is lower than the 0.05 significance threshold. This indicates that the spatial autocorrelation is statistically significant.

### Conclusion:

The Moran's I test for 2021 shows moderate positive spatial autocorrelation, with a statistically significant result (p = 0.01984). This means there is strong evidence to reject the null hypothesis of no spatial autocorrelation, indicating that areas with similar PCI Scores in 2021 are more likely to cluster geographically.

## 2022

```{r}
# Step 1: Create spatial weights matrix (Queen Contiguity)
coords_global_2022 <- st_centroid(st_geometry(PCI_2022_data)) # Use centroids of polygons
nb_global_2022 <- poly2nb(PCI_2022_data, queen = TRUE) # Create neighbors list using queen contiguity
lw_global_2022 <- nb2listw(nb_global_2022, style = "W") # Convert to weights list (row-standardized
```

```{r}
#covert to numeric for PCI 2022
PCI_2022_data$The.Weighted.PCI.Score <- as.numeric(PCI_2022_data$The.Weighted.PCI.Score)
# Step 2: Compute Global Moran's I
global_moran_2022 <- moran.test(PCI_2022_data$The.Weighted.PCI.Score, lw_global_2022)
# Step 3: Print the results
print(global_moran_2022)
```

1.  **Moran's I statistic**: The Moran's I statistic is 0.2409, a positive value indicating moderate to strong positive spatial autocorrelation. This suggests that locations with similar Weighted PCI Scores in 2022 tend to cluster geographically.

2.  **Expectation**: The expected value of Moran's I under the null hypothesis of no spatial autocorrelation is -0.0175, which is typical for random spatial patterns.

3.  **Variance**: The variance of the Moran's I statistic is 0.00855, used to evaluate the statistical significance of the observed Moran's I value.

4.  **Standard deviate (Z-score)**: The Z-score of 2.7947 indicates that the observed Moran's I statistic is nearly 2.8 standard deviations above the expected value under the null hypothesis. This points to a strong degree of spatial clustering.

5.  **p-value**: The p-value is 0.002597, which is well below the typical significance threshold of 0.05. This means the result is highly statistically significant.

### Conclusion:

The Moran's I test for 2022 shows strong positive spatial autocorrelation, with a highly significant p-value (0.002597). This provides strong evidence to reject the null hypothesis of no spatial autocorrelation, indicating that areas with similar PCI Scores in 2022 are highly likely to cluster geographically. The spatial clustering observed in 2022 is stronger and more significant than in previous years.

# Preparing Data for LISA of PCI

These codse enhances the **PCI 2012-2022** dataset by adding spatial contiguity and weight information as new columns:

1.  **Calculate Neighbor List**: `st_contiguity(geometry)` identifies neighboring provinces for each province based on contiguity, and the result is stored in the new column `nb`. This function creates a list where each province has a record of which other provinces are contiguous to it.

2.  **Assign Weights to Neighbors**: `st_weights(nb, style="W")` calculates a **row-standardized weight** for each neighbor in `nb`, stored in the new column `wt`. The `style="W"` parameter means that the weights for each province's neighbors will sum to 1. This type of weight structure is useful for spatial analysis, as it standardizes the influence each neighboring province has on the focal province.

3.  **Place Columns at the Beginning**: The `.before = 1` argument ensures that the new columns (`nb` and `wt`) are positioned at the beginning of the dataset, making them easy to access and review during analysis.

This setup embeds spatial structure directly into the PCI dataset, preparing it for further spatial econometric analysis by linking each province with its neighbors and assigning standardized weights.

The 2nd code performs **Local Moran's I analysis** on the **PCI data for 2012-2022** to identify spatial autocorrelation at the provincial level:

1.  **Calculate Local Moran's I**: `local_moran(PCI.2012, nb, wt, nsim=99)` computes Local Moran's I statistic for the `PCI.2012` variable, which represents the Provincial Competitiveness Index for each province. This function assesses the degree of spatial autocorrelation locally, identifying clusters and outliers of high or low PCI values relative to neighboring provinces:

    -   `nb`: The neighbors list (spatial contiguity) column created earlier.

    -   `wt`: The spatial weights column.

    -   `nsim=99`: Sets the number of simulations to 99, used for significance testing to evaluate if the observed spatial patterns are statistically significant.

2.  **Store Results in `local_moran` Column**: This result is saved as a new column `local_moran`. The `.before=1` argument ensures that `local_moran` is placed at the start of the data frame for easy access.

3.  **Unnest the Results**: `unnest(local_moran)` expands the `local_moran` column if it contains nested data (e.g., lists of statistics for each province), spreading them into separate columns. This makes the Local Moran's I values for each province more accessible for further analysis or visualization.

The resulting `lisa_2012` dataset provides **Local Moran's I values** for each province, allowing me to map spatial clusters and test for the presence of spatially structured patterns in PCI values across Vietnam. And I repeat the above steps for the remaining years

# Visualising LISA of PCI

This code filters the **Local Moran’s I analysis results** to keep only the provinces with **statistically significant spatial autocorrelation** at the 5% level:

1.  **Filter Significant Results**: `filter(p_ii < 0.05)` selects only rows where `p_ii`, the p-value for the Local Moran's I statistic, is less than 0.05. This threshold indicates a statistically significant result, meaning that the observed clustering or dispersion in PCI values is unlikely due to random chance (with a confidence level of 95%).

2.  **Create `lisa_sig_2012` Dataset**: The filtered dataset `lisa_sig_2012` now contains only those provinces with significant Local Moran's I values, indicating significant clusters or spatial outliers of the PCI in 2012.

This refined dataset enables focused analysis or visualization of areas with meaningful spatial patterns in competitiveness, highlighting where PCI scores are spatially clustered or anomalous. And I repeat again for the remaining years

### Reasons for Using the 5% Threshold

1.  **Standard in Statistical Testing**: The 5% threshold has become a conventional standard across many fields, balancing rigor with a manageable likelihood of Type I error (incorrectly rejecting a true null hypothesis).

2.  **Interpretability**: Results significant at the 5% level suggest a 95% confidence that there is a non-random spatial pattern, making findings more reliable and interpretable.

3.  **Trade-Off**: Lowering the threshold (e.g., 1%) increases confidence but might miss some true effects, while a higher threshold (e.g., 10%) increases sensitivity but could result in more false positives. The 5% level strikes a balance between these.

Using this threshold in your Local Moran’s I analysis ensures that significant spatial patterns are both reliable and meaningful.

Conducting a Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA) analysis for PCI over multiple years, from 2012 to 2022, offers a powerful way to observe trends, patterns, and changes in spatial clustering across Vietnam. Here’s a structured approach for observations and conclusions when analyzing multi-year LISA cluster maps:

### Observations (Trends Over Time):

1.  **Consistency in Spatial Clustering**:

    -   **Persistent Clusters**: Identify if there are regions where high or low PCI clusters have remained stable over the years. This would indicate areas with long-standing socioeconomic or environmental characteristics.

    -   **Shifting Clusters**: Observe if clusters have shifted geographically. For instance, regions that were high-PCI in 2012 but have declined by 2022, or vice versa, might reflect economic development or degradation in certain areas.

2.  **Emergence of New Clusters**:

    -   If new clusters (either high or low) appear in certain regions over the years, it could suggest changes in local conditions, such as new infrastructure projects, changes in industrial activity, or environmental policies impacting PCI.

    -   **Central and Peripheral Changes**: Note if certain central regions have consistently high PCI clusters compared to more peripheral regions that may struggle with low PCI clusters. This could hint at centralized development.

3.  **Magnitude of PCI Values**:

    -   **Increasing High-PCI Clusters**: A gradual increase in green shades (0.5 to 1.5) could indicate economic growth or improvements in living standards in certain areas.

    -   **Expanding Low-PCI Clusters**: An increase in red or orange clusters (-1.0 to -1.5) over time might indicate growing socioeconomic challenges or environmental issues in specific regions.

4.  **Regional Policy Impact**:

    -   Compare LISA maps pre- and post-specific policy interventions. For example, if a new economic development program was launched in a particular region around 2015, check for positive PCI clustering trends after that year. Similarly, if certain regions faced challenges like natural disasters, this could be reflected in their spatial patterns.

5.  **Inter-Regional Comparisons**:

    -   Over time, you may see certain regions improving faster than others. This could highlight disparities in regional development and might suggest the need for targeted support in lagging areas.

### Conclusion:

1.  **Identify Consistent and Changing Patterns**:

    -   Conclude by highlighting regions with stable high or low PCI clusters, which suggest persistent conditions. For instance, if a particular province consistently shows high PCI values, it may be economically robust and potentially a model for other areas. Regions with stable low PCI clusters may need sustained assistance or new policy initiatives.

2.  **Analyze Temporal Changes**:

    -   Recognize any significant shifts over the decade. For example, if northern Vietnam shows a gradual increase in PCI clusters, it may indicate that targeted development policies have been successful there. Conversely, areas with worsening PCI over time may require reevaluation of local policies.

3.  **Policy Implications**:

    -   Suggest that policymakers focus on emerging low-PCI clusters or regions with persistent low values. The analysis can guide resource allocation, with higher investments in regions where PCI has not improved significantly over the years.

    -   For regions showing improvement, policymakers can investigate successful practices and potentially replicate these strategies in struggling areas.

tm_shape(PCI_2022_data) +
  tm_polygons("local_moran_2022", 
              title = "Local Moran's I (PCI Clusters)",

  tm_layout(main.title = "LISA Cluster Map: PCI", 
            legend.outside = TRUE)
```

1.  **High-High Clusters (Hotspots)**: These areas, indicated by dark green, are likely the most economically vibrant regions. Urban centers or economically prosperous areas fall into this category.

2.  **Low-Low Clusters (Cold spots)**: Dark red regions indicate significant economic challenges, highlighting areas needing substantial policy intervention and development efforts.

3.  **Transitional Zones**: Yellow to light green areas represent moderate competitiveness. These regions are improving but still require support to sustain growth.

-   **Low-Low Clusters (Light Blue)**: These regions have low values surrounded by other low-value regions. They are likely areas with economic or developmental challenges.

-   **High-Low Clusters (Green)**: High-value regions surrounded by low-value areas. These might be urban centers or economically prosperous areas adjacent to less developed regions, indicating a stark socio-economic contrast.

-   **Low-High Clusters (Purple)**: Low-value regions surrounded by high-value areas. These could be rural or underdeveloped regions located near more prosperous areas.

-   **High-High Clusters (Red)**: High-value areas surrounded by other high-value regions. These are likely major urban centers or regions with significant economic activity.

# Computing local Gi\* statistics for PCI

```{r}
wm_idw_2022 <- PCI_2022_data %>% 
  mutate(nb=st_contiguity(geometry),
         wts = st_inverse_distance(nb,geometry,
                                   scale=1,
                                   alpha=1),
         .before = 1)
```

1.  **Calculate Neighbor List**:

    -   `st_contiguity(geometry)` identifies neighboring provinces based on their geometry. This creates a list that shows which provinces are contiguous to each other.

2.  **Compute Weights Using Inverse Distance**:

    -   `st_inverse_distance(nb, geometry, scale=1, alpha=1)` calculates the inverse distance weights based on the contiguity of provinces:

        -   **`nb`**: The neighbors list created from the `st_contiguity` function.

        -   **`geometry`**: The geometrical representation of the provinces.

        -   **`scale`**: This parameter controls the scaling of the distance; a value of 1 typically means that distances are used directly.

        -   **`alpha`**: This parameter determines how much influence nearby provinces have compared to those farther away. An `alpha` of 1 indicates a direct inverse distance weighting, where closer provinces have significantly more influence than those farther away.

3.  **Store New Columns at the Beginning**:

    -   The `.before = 1` argument ensures that the newly calculated columns (`nb` for neighbors and `wts` for weights) are placed at the beginning of the dataset, making them readily accessible for subsequent analysis.

### Overall Purpose

The resulting dataset `wm_idw_2022` now contains:

-   A `nb` column indicating the neighboring provinces for each province.

-   A `wts` column that holds the inverse distance weights, reflecting the spatial relationships among provinces based on their distances.

This setup is useful for spatial interpolation or analysis, particularly in creating maps or conducting further spatial econometric modeling that accounts for the influence of nearby provinces on each other.

```{r}
HCSA_2022 <- wm_idw_2022 %>% 
  mutate(local_Gi = local_gstar_perm(
    The.Weighted.PCI.Score,nb,wt,nsim=99),
    .before=1) %>% 
      unnest(local_Gi)
```

The resulting dataset `HCSA_2022` now contains:

-   The original data from `wm_idw_2022`, including the weighted PCI scores and the neighbors list.

-   A new column `local_Gi` that contains the local Getis-Ord Gi\* statistics for each province, reflecting the degree of spatial clustering of high or low values in the weighted PCI scores.

This setup allows for further analysis of spatial patterns in competitiveness scores, helping to identify areas of high performance (hot spots) or low performance (cold spots) in the context of provincial competitiveness in Vietnam for 2022.

# Visualising hot spot and cold spot areas

```{r}
HCSA_sig_2022 <- HCSA_2022 %>% 
  filter(p_sim<0.05)
tmap_mode("plot")
tm_shape(HCSA_2022)+
  tm_polygons()+
  tm_borders(alpha=0.5)+
tm_shape(HCSA_sig_2022)+
  tm_fill("gi_star")+
  tm_borders(alpha=0.4)
```

### **Key Observations:**

1.  *Gi Statistic (Hotspot and Cold Spot Identification):*\*

    -   The `gi_star` variable, shown in the legend, represents the Gi\* statistic values.

    -   The shaded areas in varying tones of orange and yellow likely represent hotspots where there is a significant clustering of high values. These are areas where the variable being analyzed (perhaps a social, economic, or conflict-related metric) shows statistically significant concentrations.

    -   The color scale on the map legend represents the range of Gi\* values:

        -   Light yellow (`2.6 to 2.8`): Lower intensity of clustering.

        -   Darker orange (`3.4 to 3.6`): Higher intensity of clustering, indicating stronger hotspots.

    -   The non-colored regions do not appear to show statistically significant hotspots or cold spots.

2.  **Significant Areas:**

    -   The map emphasizes the northern region of Vietnam, particularly around the Red River Delta, which is shown in darker orange shades.

    -   This suggests that the region around the capital, Hanoi, or its surroundings might be a significant hotspot for the analyzed variable (perhaps economic activity, conflict events, or health-related data).

    -   The surrounding provinces have slightly lower Gi\* values but are still within the statistically significant range, as represented by lighter shades.

3.  **Statistical Significance:**

    -   The filtering process using `p_sim < 0.05` implies that the areas highlighted in the map have passed a threshold of statistical significance (p-value \< 0.05). This means the clustering is unlikely to be due to random chance and points to real spatial patterns in the data.

This map effectively visualizes significant hotspot areas in northern Vietnam, showing where high values of the analyzed variable (possibly conflict data, health statistics, or economic factors) cluster spatially. The stronger hotspots are concentrated around the Red River Delta area, suggesting important spatial trends. No cold spots are observed, indicating that the focus is primarily on regions with high-value clustering.

For a geospatial analyst, this map offers insights into spatial patterns that could inform policy decisions, resource allocation, or further investigation into why certain areas exhibit higher intensity for the variable being analyzed.

# Calculate Getis-Ord Gi* statistic for each region
gi_star <- localG(PCI_2022_data$The.Weighted.PCI.Score, lw)

# Add Gi* values to the data
PCI_2022_data$gi_star <- as.numeric(gi_star)

# Create a hotspot map
tm_shape(PCI_2022_data) +
  tm_polygons("gi_star", 
              title = "Getis-Ord Gi* (PCI Hotspots)", 
              palette = "YlOrRd", 
              style = "cont") + 
  tm_layout(main.title = "Hotspot Analysis: PCI", 
            legend.outside = TRUE)
```

-   *Getis-Ord Gi Statistic (Hotspot and Cold Spot Identification):*\*

    -   **Hotspots (Red Areas):**

        -   Provinces colored in **red** show significant clustering of **high PCI values**, meaning these regions exhibit **high competitiveness** in business and economic performance.

        -   This suggests these provinces offer favorable conditions for businesses, such as efficient government services, good infrastructure, or policies that attract investment.

        -   Key regions with high competitiveness (hotspots) are:

            -   **Northern Vietnam**: Several provinces show up as red, indicating this region is a competitive hub.

            -   **Central Vietnam**: Another area of high competitiveness, likely with favorable governance or economic policies that contribute to its strong PCI score.

    -   **Cold Spots (Dark Areas):**

        -   The map also shows **cold spots** (with negative Gi\* values), which represent provinces with **low competitiveness**. These are regions where low PCI scores cluster, indicating they are less attractive for business or have poor economic governance.

        -   A few provinces in **central Vietnam** fall into this category, suggesting these areas might face challenges such as bureaucracy, underdeveloped infrastructure, or less favorable conditions for economic growth.

    -   **Intermediate Areas (Yellow to Orange):**

        -   Provinces in **yellow to orange** have moderate PCI values, indicating no significant clustering of competitiveness. These areas are neither clear hotspots nor cold spots but fall somewhere in the middle in terms of their competitive standing.

-   **Significant Regional Trends:**

    -   **Northern Vietnam**:

        -   The northern provinces are a clear hotspot for competitiveness, particularly around the capital region of Hanoi. This likely reflects the concentration of government institutions, better infrastructure, and higher foreign direct investment (FDI) in the region.

    -   **Central Vietnam**:

        -   The central regions of Vietnam are somewhat mixed, with both cold spots and hotspots present. Certain areas are performing well, while others lag in terms of competitiveness.

    -   **Southern Vietnam**:

        -   A few provinces in the southern part of Vietnam, particularly around the Mekong Delta and near Ho Chi Minh City, are moderately competitive but don’t form strong clusters of high or low competitiveness.

-   **Insights for Policy and Business:**

    -   **Hotspot Areas** (Red) should be regarded as prime locations for further investment and expansion, given their strong competitive environment.

    -   **Cold Spot Areas** (Dark) may require policy interventions, such as improvements in governance, infrastructure, or business regulations to enhance competitiveness.

    -   **Yellow to Orange Areas** may be transitioning or developing regions where businesses might experience mixed results depending on local factors.

### **Conclusion:**

This map is a useful tool for understanding the **spatial patterns of competitiveness** in Vietnam's provinces. The identified **hotspots** in the north and central parts of the country represent regions where businesses are thriving, and the business environment is supportive of economic growth. Meanwhile, the **cold spots** point to provinces that may be struggling and in need of policy reforms or infrastructure investments to boost their competitiveness. This type of analysis can inform government initiatives, business decisions, and investments by highlighting where competitive advantages or disadvantages are geographically concentrated.

### **The First Map: Hotspot/Cold Spot Areas (HCSA)**

#### **Purpose and Data:**

-   This map focuses on **hotspot and cold spot areas** in Vietnam using a general clustering method (as per the provided screenshot).

-   It seems to visualize the **spatial autocorrelation** of some variable, though the specific indicator (HCSA) isn’t explicitly provided.

-   The focus is on identifying statistically significant clusters of high or low values of this variable across Vietnamese provinces.

#### **Analysis:**

-   **Hotspots (colored regions)**:

    -   The map shows clusters in the **northern part of Vietnam** with higher significance, implying these regions are “hotspots” for the analyzed variable.

    -   These might represent areas with heightened activity (such as economic growth, conflict, population density, etc.) depending on the variable measured.

-   **Cold spots (gray regions)**:

    -   Areas without strong statistical significance (gray areas) represent regions that do not exhibit clustering of high or low values. They could be either average or neutral in the context of the analyzed variable.

-   **Significance Filter**:

    -   The map uses a significance filter (`p < 0.05`), which focuses only on regions where clustering is statistically significant, discarding areas that do not meet the threshold.

### 2. **The Second Map: Provincial Competitiveness Index (PCI)**

#### **Purpose and Data:**

-   This map visualizes **hotspots and cold spots** of competitiveness using the **Provincial Competitiveness Index (PCI)**, which measures the economic governance, infrastructure, and ease of doing business across Vietnamese provinces.

#### **Analysis:**

-   **Hotspots (red areas)**:

    -   The red-colored provinces are **competitive hotspots**, indicating they have high PCI values. These are areas with business-friendly environments, strong governance, and infrastructure, likely promoting economic growth.

    -   Regions in **Northern Vietnam** are highlighted as the most competitive, which is likely driven by proximity to Hanoi and other key economic hubs.

-   \**Cold spots (negative Gi* values, darker areas)\*\*:

    -   The dark-colored provinces are **less competitive** regions with low PCI values. These areas may have poor infrastructure, more bureaucratic hurdles, or other barriers to business growth.

    -   Central and southern Vietnam seem to exhibit mixed levels of competitiveness, with some areas lagging in their PCI scores.

### **Key Differences:**

1.  **Variable Analyzed**:

    -   The **first map** (HCSA) visualizes a general hotspot/cold spot analysis, but the specific variable isn't named. It likely measures clusters of significance for a variable like population density, conflict, or another socioeconomic metric.

    -   The **second map** clearly visualizes **competitiveness** using the PCI, which is an economic indicator measuring how conducive regions are to business activity.

2.  **Spatial Pattern and Hotspot Distribution**:

    -   The **first map** shows hotspots mostly in the northern region of Vietnam but in a broader and less defined context.

    -   The **second map** shows more detailed hotspots of high competitiveness (high PCI values) with a clearer focus on economic performance, with key competitiveness clusters in the north, central, and parts of the south.

3.  **Geospatial Significance**:

    -   The **first map** focuses purely on **statistical significance** (`p < 0.05`), meaning it highlights areas where clustering is statistically reliable without necessarily specifying the nature (positive or negative).

    -   The **second map** focuses on both **positive (hotspots)** and **negative (cold spots)** in the context of competitiveness, offering a clear contrast between provinces that are competitive and those that are not.

4.  **Interpretation and Policy Implications**:

    -   The **first map** is more general and could apply to any socioeconomic or environmental variable, depending on what HCSA represents.

    -   The **second map** provides actionable insights specific to **economic policy** and **business development**, showing where investments or policy interventions could improve provincial competitiveness.

### **Conclusion:**

Both maps provide insight into spatial clustering in Vietnam but do so for different purposes and variables. The **first map** highlights general hotspots and cold spots based on statistical clustering, while the **second map** gives specific information on provincial competitiveness. The second map is more directly tied to economic and business strategy, while the first could have a broader set of applications depending on the variable being analyzed.

**Moran's I Test**

The positive Moran's I statistic (0.169) suggests a tendency for projects to cluster spatially.

Since p-value of 0.002187 \< 0.05, there's strong statistical evidence against the null hypothesis no of spatial autocorrelation.

This means we can conclude there's significant positive spatial clustering in our data -areas with high values are near other areas with high values

**Monte Carlo Simulation**

Since p-value of 0.1 \> 0.05, this suggests that while the result is suggestive of spatial clustering, it is not statistically significant

After increasing the number of simulations, the result is still around 0.05.

Thus, we conclude that while there is a suggestive pattern of clustering, the results do not provide sufficient statistical evidence for significant spatial autocorrelation in the Monte Carlo analysis.

global_moran_perm_result_registered_capital
```

**Moran's I Test**

The positive Moran's I statistic (0.3977) suggests a tendency for projects to cluster spatially.

Since p-value of 3.004e-07 \< 0.05, there's strong statistical evidence against the null hypothesis no of spatial autocorrelation

This means we can conclude there's significant positive spatial clustering in our data -areas with high values are near other areas with high values

**Monte Carlo Simulation**

Since p-value of 2.2e-16 \< 0.05, there's strong statistical evidence against the null hypothesis no of spatial autocorrelation

This p-value, being far below 0.05, reinforces the conclusion of significant spatial autocorrelation.

Therefore, we conclude that the clustering observed in total registered capital is statistically significant, indicating a robust spatial pattern in the data.
:::

The analysis reveals significant spatial clustering for **Total Registered Capital**, suggesting that regions with high registered capital are often near other high-value areas. (Vice versa)

In contrast, while the **Total Projects** analysis suggests some spatial clustering, the results from the Monte Carlo simulation do not show statistical significance. This indicates that the clustering observed for total projects may not be robust enough to inform strategic decisions.

### Overview

This Shiny app allows users to analyze the Provincial Competitiveness Index (PCI) for Vietnam. It features spatial analysis tools, including the Gi\* hotspot and Local Moran’s I (LISA) maps, to identify significant spatial patterns in PCI data.

### Layout

-   **Title of Application**: Displays the app's name or purpose.

-   **Navigation Bar Menu**: Includes options to switch between different analysis sections:

    -   **Emerging Hotspot Analysis of PCI**: Displays the Gi\* hotspot analysis for PCI.

    -   **Local Moran of PCI**: Shows the LISA map for PCI.

### Sidebar Panel (Calibration Inputs)

Each analysis section has unique calibration inputs to customize the displayed maps:

#### *Gi Hotspot Analysis of PCI*\*

In this section, users can view the Gi\* hotspot map, which identifies spatial clusters of high and low PCI values.

1.  **Mapping Variable (Year)**: Select the PCI year to analyze.

    -   Options: 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022.

2.  **Classification Method**: Choose a method for classifying PCI values on the map.

    -   Options: `cont`, `equal`, `pretty`, `quantile`, `kmeans`, `hclust`, `bclust`, `fisher`, `jenks`.

3.  **Number of Classes**: Set the number of classification levels (between 5 and 10) for the PCI values.

4.  **Colour Scheme**: Select a color scheme to visualize PCI hotspots and cold spots.

    -   Options: Blues, Reds, Greens, Yellow-Orange-Red, Yellow-Orange-Brown, Yellow-Green, Orange-Red.

5.  **Level of Transparency**: Adjust the map's opacity for better visual contrast (range: 0 to 1).

#### **Local Moran of PCI**

This section displays the LISA map, which highlights local clusters and spatial outliers based on Local Moran's I statistic.

1.  **Mapping Variable (Year)**: Select the PCI year to analyze.

    -   Options are dynamically populated based on available data.

2.  **Contiguity Method**: Choose the spatial contiguity method.

    -   Options: `Queen` (default) or `Rook`.

3.  **Spatial Weights Style**: Select a weighting style for spatial association.

    -   Options: `W` (Row standardized), `B` (Binary), `C` (Globally standardized), `U` (C / number of neighbors), `minmax`, `S` (Variance).

4.  **Number of Simulations**: Set the number of simulations for significance testing (between 99 and 499).

5.  **Confidence Level**: Select the confidence level for the LISA significance results.

    -   Options: 95% (0.05) or 99% (0.01).

6.  **LISA Classification**: Select a classification method for the LISA clusters.

    -   Options: `mean`, `median`, `pysal`.

7.  **Local Moran's Statistic**: Choose the type of Local Moran’s statistic to display.

    -   Options: `local moran(ii)`, `expectation(eii)`, `variance(var_ii)`, `std deviation(z_ii)`, `P-value`.

### Main Panel (Maps and Charts)

The Main Panel displays the results based on the selected calibration inputs:

1.  **Emerging Hotspot Analysis of PCI**: The Gi\* hotspot map highlights significant PCI hotspots (high PCI clusters) and cold spots (low PCI clusters) across provinces for the selected year.

2.  **Local Moran of PCI**: The LISA map shows spatial clusters of similar PCI levels and outliers, indicating local dependencies or deviations.

### How to Use the App

1.  **Select the desired analysis in the Navigation Bar**: Choose either "Emerging Hotspot Analysis of PCI" or "Local Moran of PCI" to start.

2.  **Adjust Calibration Inputs in the Sidebar**:

    -   Configure settings such as the year, classification method, color scheme, and others to customize the map.

3.  **View the Map in the Main Panel**:

    -   The selected map (Gi\* hotspot or LISA) will display spatial clusters or significant hotspots based on the specified inputs.
