Notice that the argument ***adaptive*** is set to **FALSE** indicates that we are interested to compute the fixed bandwidth.\n\nThere are two possible approaches can be uused to determine the stopping rule, they are: CV cross-validation approach and AIC corrected (AICc) approach. We define the stopping rule using ***approach*** argeement.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbw.fixed <- bw.gwr(formula = SELLING_PRICE ~ AREA_SQM + AGE + PROX_CBD + \n                     PROX_CHILDCARE + PROX_ELDERLYCARE  + PROX_URA_GROWTH_AREA + \n                     PROX_MRT   + PROX_PARK + PROX_PRIMARY_SCH + \n                     PROX_SHOPPING_MALL + PROX_BUS_STOP + NO_Of_UNITS + \n                     FAMILY_FRIENDLY + FREEHOLD, \n                   data=condo_resale.sp, \n                   approach=\"CV\", \n                   kernel=\"gaussian\", \n                   adaptive=FALSE, \n                   longlat=FALSE)\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe result shows that the recommended bandwidth is 971.3405 metres.\n\n**Quiz: Do you know why it is in metre?**\n\nThe bandwidth in this case is measured in meters because the **`longlat=FALSE`** argument was set in the spatial analysis function.\n\nBy default, many spatial libraries use geographic coordinates (longitude and latitude) when **`longlat=TRUE`**, meaning that distances are interpreted in angular units (degrees). However, when **`longlat=FALSE`**, the analysis assumes a projected coordinate system where distances are measured in linear units like meters or kilometers, which is common for accurate spatial distance measurements in GIS.\n\nIn other words, the analysis is performed in a projected coordinate system, such as UTM where the units are in meters. This is essential for accurate distance-based calculations, like kernel density estimation, which would be incorrect if the distances were interpreted in degrees.\n\nSo, the bandwidth is in meters because the spatial data has been projected into a system that uses meters as the unit of measurement.\n\n#### 13.9.1.2 GWModel method - fixed bandwith\n\nNow we can use the code chunk below to calibrate the gwr model using fixed bandwidth and gaussian kernel.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngwr.fixed <- gwr.basic(formula = SELLING_PRICE ~ AREA_SQM + AGE + PROX_CBD + \n                         PROX_CHILDCARE + PROX_ELDERLYCARE  + PROX_URA_GROWTH_AREA + \n                         PROX_MRT   + PROX_PARK + PROX_PRIMARY_SCH + \n                         PROX_SHOPPING_MALL + PROX_BUS_STOP + NO_Of_UNITS + \n                         FAMILY_FRIENDLY + FREEHOLD, \n                       data=condo_resale.sp, \n                       bw=bw.fixed, \n                       kernel = 'gaussian', \n                       longlat = FALSE)\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe output is saved in a list of class “gwrm”. The code below can be used to display the model output.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngwr.fixed\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe report shows that the AICc of the gwr is 42263.61 which is significantly smaller than the globel multiple linear regression model of 42967.1.\n\n### **13.9.2 Building Adaptive Bandwidth GWR Model**\n\nIn this section, we will calibrate the gwr-based hedonic pricing model by using adaptive bandwidth approach.\n\n#### 13.9.2.1 Computing the adaptive bandwidth\n\nSimilar to the earlier section, we will first use `bw.gwr()` to determine the recommended data point to use.\n\nThe code chunk used look very similar to the one used to compute the fixed bandwidth except the `adaptive` argument has changed to **TRUE**.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbw.adaptive <- bw.gwr(formula = SELLING_PRICE ~ AREA_SQM + AGE  + \n                        PROX_CBD + PROX_CHILDCARE + PROX_ELDERLYCARE    + \n                        PROX_URA_GROWTH_AREA + PROX_MRT + PROX_PARK + \n                        PROX_PRIMARY_SCH + PROX_SHOPPING_MALL   + PROX_BUS_STOP + \n                        NO_Of_UNITS + FAMILY_FRIENDLY + FREEHOLD, \n                      data=condo_resale.sp, \n                      approach=\"CV\", \n                      kernel=\"gaussian\", \n                      adaptive=TRUE, \n                      longlat=FALSE)\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe result shows that the 30 is the recommended data points to be used.\n\n#### 13.9.2.2 Constructing the adaptive bandwidth gwr model\n\nNow, we can go ahead to calibrate the gwr-based hedonic pricing model by using adaptive bandwidth and gaussian kernel as shown in the code chunk below.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngwr.adaptive <- gwr.basic(formula = SELLING_PRICE ~ AREA_SQM + AGE + \n                            PROX_CBD + PROX_CHILDCARE + PROX_ELDERLYCARE + \n                            PROX_URA_GROWTH_AREA + PROX_MRT + PROX_PARK + \n                            PROX_PRIMARY_SCH + PROX_SHOPPING_MALL + PROX_BUS_STOP + \n                            NO_Of_UNITS + FAMILY_FRIENDLY + FREEHOLD, \n                          data=condo_resale.sp, bw=bw.adaptive, \n                          kernel = 'gaussian', \n                          adaptive=TRUE, \n                          longlat = FALSE)\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe code below can be used to display the model output.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngwr.adaptive\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe report shows that the AICc the adaptive distance gwr is 41982.22 which is even smaller than the AICc of the fixed distance gwr of 42263.61.\n\n### **13.9.3 Visualising GWR Output**\n\nIn addition to regression residuals, the output feature class table includes fields for observed and predicted y values, condition number (cond), Local R2, residuals, and explanatory variable coefficients and standard errors:\n\n-   Condition Number: this diagnostic evaluates local collinearity. In the presence of strong local collinearity, results become unstable. Results associated with condition numbers larger than 30, may be unreliable.\n\n-   Local R2: these values range between 0.0 and 1.0 and indicate how well the local regression model fits observed y values. Very low values indicate the local model is performing poorly. Mapping the Local R2 values to see where GWR predicts well and where it predicts poorly may provide clues about important variables that may be missing from the regression model.\n\n-   Predicted: these are the estimated (or fitted) y values 3. computed by GWR.\n\n-   Residuals: to obtain the residual values, the fitted y values are subtracted from the observed y values. Standardized residuals have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of 1. A cold-to-hot rendered map of standardized residuals can be produce by using these values.\n\n-   Coefficient Standard Error: these values measure the reliability of each coefficient estimate. Confidence in those estimates are higher when standard errors are small in relation to the actual coefficient values. Large standard errors may indicate problems with local collinearity.\n\nThey are all stored in a SpatialPointsDataFrame or SpatialPolygonsDataFrame object integrated with fit.points, GWR coefficient estimates, y value, predicted values, coefficient standard errors and t-values in its “data” slot in an object called **SDF** of the output list.\n\n### **13.9.4 Converting SDF into *sf* data.frame**\n\nTo visualise the fields in **SDF**, we need to first covert it into **sf** data.frame by using the code chunk below.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncondo_resale.sf.adaptive <- st_as_sf(gwr.adaptive$SDF) %>%\n  st_transform(crs=3414)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncondo_resale.sf.adaptive.svy21 <- st_transform(condo_resale.sf.adaptive, 3414)\ncondo_resale.sf.adaptive.svy21  \n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngwr.adaptive.output <- as.data.frame(gwr.adaptive$SDF)\ncondo_resale.sf.adaptive <- cbind(condo_resale.res.sf, as.matrix(gwr.adaptive.output))\n```\n:::\n\n\nNext, `glimpse()` is used to display the content of *condo_resale.sf.adaptive* sf data frame.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nglimpse(condo_resale.sf.adaptive)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsummary(gwr.adaptive$SDF$yhat)\n```\n:::\n\n\n### **13.9.5 Visualising local R2**\n\nThe code chunks below is used to create an interactive point symbol map.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntmap_mode(\"view\")\ntm_shape(mpsz_svy21)+\n  tm_polygons(alpha = 0.1) +\ntm_shape(condo_resale.sf.adaptive) +  \n  tm_dots(col = \"Local_R2\",\n          border.col = \"gray60\",\n          border.lwd = 1) +\n  tm_view(set.zoom.limits = c(11,14))\n```\n:::\n\n\nSet back to plotting mode\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntmap_mode(\"plot\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n### **13.9.6 Visualising coefficient estimates**\n\nThe code chunks below is used to create an interactive point symbol map.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntmap_mode(\"view\")\nAREA_SQM_SE <- tm_shape(mpsz_svy21)+\n  tm_polygons(alpha = 0.1) +\ntm_shape(condo_resale.sf.adaptive) +  \n  tm_dots(col = \"AREA_SQM_SE\",\n          border.col = \"gray60\",\n          border.lwd = 1) +\n  tm_view(set.zoom.limits = c(11,14))\n\nAREA_SQM_TV <- tm_shape(mpsz_svy21)+\n  tm_polygons(alpha = 0.1) +\ntm_shape(condo_resale.sf.adaptive) +  \n  tm_dots(col = \"AREA_SQM_TV\",\n          border.col = \"gray60\",\n          border.lwd = 1) +\n  tm_view(set.zoom.limits = c(11,14))\n\ntmap_arrange(AREA_SQM_SE, AREA_SQM_TV, \n             asp=1, ncol=2,\n             sync = TRUE)\n```\n:::\n\n\nSet back to plotting mode\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntmap_mode(\"plot\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n#### 13.9.6.1 By URA Plannign Region\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntm_shape(mpsz_svy21[mpsz_svy21$REGION_N==\"CENTRAL REGION\", ])+\n  tm_polygons()+\ntm_shape(condo_resale.sf.adaptive) + \n  tm_bubbles(col = \"Local_R2\",\n           size = 0.15,\n           border.col = \"gray60\",\n           border.lwd = 1)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## **13.10 Reference**\n\nGollini I, Lu B, Charlton M, Brunsdon C, Harris P (2015) “GWmodel: an R Package for exploring Spatial Heterogeneity using Geographically Weighted Models”. *Journal of Statistical Software*, 63(17):1-50, http://www.jstatsoft.org/v63/i17/\n\nLu B, Harris P, Charlton M, Brunsdon C (2014) “The GWmodel R Package: further topics for exploring Spatial Heterogeneity using GeographicallyWeighted Models”. *Geo-spatial Information Science* 17(2): 85-101, http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1009502.2014.917453\n",
