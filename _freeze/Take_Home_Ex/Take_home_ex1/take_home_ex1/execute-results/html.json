The conflict primarily involves the Myanmar military (Tatmadaw) and various ethnic armed organizations (EAOs) representing different ethnic minorities\n\n**Key Factors Contributing to the Conflict**\n\n-   **Ethnic Tensions:** Deep-rooted ethnic tensions and historical grievances have been a major driving force behind the conflict. Many ethnic minorities, such as the Rohingya, Karen, and Shan, have long sought greater autonomy or independence from the central government.  \n\n-   **Military Dominance:** The Tatmadaw has exercised significant control over Myanmar's political and military affairs for decades. Its authoritarian rule and suppression of dissent have fueled resentment among many ethnic groups.  \n\n-   **Resource Competition:** Disputes over natural resources, such as timber, jade, and gas, have also contributed to the conflict. Control of these resources can provide significant economic and political advantages.\n\n-   **External Influences:** Neighboring countries, such as China and Thailand, have sometimes been involved in the conflict, either directly or indirectly, through their support for different factions.\n\n**Recent Developments**\n\nThe conflict escalated significantly following the 2021 military coup, which ousted the democratically elected government led by Aung San Suu Kyi.\n\nThe coup sparked widespread protests and civil disobedience, leading to a crackdown by the military. This crackdown has resulted in numerous casualties and human rights abuses.  \n\nIn response to the coup, a number of armed resistance groups have emerged, including the People's Defense Forces (PDFs), which are civilian-led militias fighting against the military. These groups have engaged in clashes with the Tatmadaw across the country.\n\n# Loading Library\n\n-   **sf:** This package provides simple features for representing spatial data in R. It allows you to work with various spatial data formats, such as shapefiles, GeoJSON, and WKT.\n-   **tmap:** This package is designed for creating thematic maps in R. It offers a high-level interface for customizing maps with different styles, colors, and labels.\n-   **tidyverse:** This is a collection of R packages that work together to provide a consistent and efficient data analysis workflow. It includes packages like dplyr for data manipulation, ggplot2 for data visualization, and readr for reading data files.  \n-   **spatstat:** This package is specifically for spatial point pattern analysis.

This is done to focus on the most relevant types of conflict events for the analysis.\n\nSecondly, we convert the `event_date` column from its current format (presumably a character format) to a Date format using the `dmy()` function from the `lubridate` package. This is necessary for performing date-based calculations and visualizations.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Create a column for quarterly intervals (e.g., Q1 2021, Q2 2021, etc.)\nconflict_filtered <- conflict_filtered %>%\n  mutate(quarter = paste0(year(event_date), \"-Q\", quarter(event_date)))\n```\n:::\n\n\nFirstly,\n\n-   `year(event_date)` extracts the year from the `event_date` column.\n\n<!-- -->\n\n-   `quarter(event_date)` extracts the quarter (1, 2, 3, or 4) from the `event_date` column\n\nNext\n\n`paste0(year(event_date), \"-Q\", quarter(event_date))` concatenates the year and quarter values with a hyphen and the letter \"Q\" in between. This creates a string representing the quarterly interval, such as \"2021-Q1\" or \"2022-Q3\".\n\nFinally,we add the newly created `quarter` column to the `conflict_filtered` dataset.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Convert conflict data into an `sf` object with geometry\nconflict_sf <- st_as_sf(conflict_filtered, coords = c(\"longitude\", \"latitude\"), crs = 4326)\n\n# Ensure the boundary data and conflict data have the same CRS (coordinate reference system)\nconflict_sf <- st_transform(conflict_sf, st_crs(boundary_data))\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe convert the `conflict_filtered` data frame into a simple feature object (`sf` object) using the `st_as_sf()` function from the `sf` package.\n\n-   The `coords` argument specifies the columns containing the longitude and latitude coordinates (in this case, \"longitude\" and \"latitude\").\n\n-   The `crs` argument sets the coordinate reference system (CRS) of the resulting `sf` object to 4326, which is the World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS84) coordinate system.\n\nTo ensure the matching CRS, we line transform the CRS of the `conflict_sf` object to match the CRS of the `boundary_data` object. This is important for spatial analysis and visualization, as the two datasets must have the same CRS to be combined or compared.\n\nThe `st_transform()` function is used to perform the CRS transformation.

There are regions with a higher concentration of events, particularly in the northern and eastern parts of the country.\n\n2.  **Cluster Formation:** The map reveals clusters of conflict events, suggesting that certain areas have experienced more intense conflict activity.\n\n3.  **Spatial Patterns:** The distribution of events appears to follow certain patterns, potentially influenced by geographical factors, historical grievances, or resource competition.\n\n4.  **Event Type Variation:** The use of different colors to represent different event types allows for a visual comparison of their spatial distributions. This reveals that certain types of events may be more prevalent in specific regions.\n\n**Analysis and Explanation:**\n\n-   **Regional Hotspots:** The concentration of conflict events in the northern and eastern regions of Myanmar indicates that these areas have been particularly affected by the ongoing conflict. This could be due to a variety of factors, such as the presence of ethnic minorities seeking greater autonomy, competition for resources, or historical grievances.\n\n-   **Spatial Patterns:** The clustering of events suggests that conflict activity may be concentrated in areas with specific characteristics, such as border regions, resource-rich areas, or areas with strategic importance.\n\n-   **Event Type Distribution:** The visual representation of different event types provides insights into the nature of the conflict in different regions. For example, if battles are more prevalent in certain areas, it may suggest a more intense military confrontation.\n\n-   **Potential Causal Factors:** The spatial distribution of conflict events can be analyzed in conjunction with other geospatial data, such as population density, land use, or proximity to natural resources, to identify potential causal factors.\n\n**Overall, the map provides a valuable visual representation of the spatial dynamics of the conflict in Myanmar.** It highlights areas of intense conflict activity, reveals potential patterns in the distribution of events, and allows for a comparison of different event types. By analyzing these spatial patterns, researchers and policymakers can gain a better understanding of the underlying causes and consequences of the conflict, and develop more effective strategies for addressing it.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Temporal distribution of conflict events by quarter\nggplot(conflict_filtered, aes(x = quarter, fill = event_type)) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"stack\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"Battles\" = \"red\", \n                               \"Explosions/Remote violence\" = \"orange\", \n                               \"Strategic developments\" = \"blue\", \n                               \"Violence against civilians\" = \"purple\")) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"Temporal Distribution of Conflict Events by Quarter (2021-2024)\",\n       x = \"Quarter\", y = \"Number of Events\",\n       fill = \"Event Type\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](take_home_ex1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Key Observations:**\n\n1.  **Fluctuations:** The number of conflict events fluctuates over time, with periods of increased and decreased activity.\n\n2.  **Seasonal Patterns:** Some event types may exhibit seasonal patterns, with higher or lower occurrences during specific quarters of the year.\n\n3.  **Event Type Dominance:** Certain event types may be more prevalent than others during specific time periods.\n\n**Analysis and Explanation:**\n\n-   **Temporal Trends:** The chart reveals the overall trend of conflict activity over the four-year period. For example, there may be a general increase or decrease in the overall number of events.\n\n-   **Seasonal Patterns:** Analyzing the fluctuations within each year can help identify any seasonal patterns.

This area has long been a conflict hotspot due to the presence of multiple **ethnic armed organizations**. These groups have longstanding grievances related to autonomy, resource control, and ethnic identity, contributing to sustained violence in the region.\n\n-   **Western Myanmar:** Another major cluster of conflict events is visible in the **western part** of Myanmar, particularly along the **Bangladesh** border. This region has experienced ongoing violence, notably between the Myanmar government and the **Rohingya Muslim minority**. The conflict here is driven by issues of ethnic persecution, displacement, and military operations.\n\n#### 2. **Dispersal:**\n\n-   **Central Myanmar:** While the conflict intensity is lower in **central Myanmar** compared to the north and west, there is still a **noticeable dispersal** of armed incidents across the region. This suggests that while conflict is concentrated in specific regions, it is not entirely restricted to them, reflecting a broader, albeit less intense, spread of violence. This dispersed pattern could be linked to sporadic incidents driven by local disputes, military presence, or emerging conflicts in previously stable areas.\n\n#### 3. **Proximity to Borders:**\n\n-   **China and India:** The proximity of conflict clusters to Myanmar’s borders with **China** and **India** underscores the potential influence of these neighboring countries on the conflict dynamics. The **northern clusters** near China may be affected by cross-border trade, refugee flows, or the presence of ethnic groups with ties to both countries. Similarly, the **western cluster** along the border with India may reflect cross-border insurgency activities, refugee movements, or influence from armed groups operating in both Myanmar and neighboring territories. These areas may also serve as strategic points for armed groups benefiting from cross-border support or utilizing porous borders for logistical purposes.\n\n#### 4. **Geographic Features:**\n\n-   **Mountains and Rivers:** The spatial distribution of conflict events may also be shaped by Myanmar’s **geography**. **Mountainous regions** and **river systems** act as natural barriers that either restrict or facilitate movement. For instance, mountainous areas can serve as strategic hideouts for insurgent groups, while rivers might influence the movement of troops or refugees, shaping the spatial dynamics of the conflict. Geographic features like the **Irrawaddy River** could also play a key role in both military strategies and the logistical support of rebel factions.\n\n### Overall Insights:\n\nThe KDE map provides critical insights into the spatial distribution of armed conflict events in Myanmar during Q3 2021. It illustrates:\n\n-   **Concentrated hotspots** in the north and west, reflecting deeply entrenched conflicts driven by ethnic, political, and territorial factors.\n\n-   A **dispersal of conflict incidents** in central Myanmar, suggesting that while the region is less volatile than the borders, it remains susceptible to isolated violence.\n\n-   The **influence of neighboring countries** like China and India on conflict dynamics, with border regions experiencing heightened intensity likely due to cross-border insurgency or support.\n\n-   The potential impact of **geographic features**, such as mountains and rivers, on conflict patterns, shaping where and how violence spreads.\n\nThese findings can inform **conflict analysis, humanitarian interventions, and policy planning** by identifying both high-intensity conflict zones and areas vulnerable to future escalations. Additionally, understanding the role of geography and international borders in shaping conflict may guide cross-border cooperation and peacebuilding efforts.\n\n# Plotting 2nd Order Spatial Point Pattern\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Take a random sample of 1000 events if the dataset is large\nset.seed(123)  # Ensure reproducibility\nsampled_conflict_ppp <- conflict_ppp[sample(1:npoints(conflict_ppp), 1000)]\n# Compute Ripley's K function to analyze clustering or dispersion\nK <- Kest(sampled_conflict_ppp, correction = \"Ripley\")\n\n# Plot Ripley's K function\nplot(K, main = \"Ripley's K for Conflict Events (Q3 2021)\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Understanding K-Test\n\nRipley’s K function is a prominent statistical tool used to explore the spatial distribution of point patterns, providing insight into whether points (in this case, conflict events) are clustered, dispersed, or randomly distributed. Below is a detailed interpretation of the analysis based on Ripley’s K function for conflict events in Myanmar.\n\n#### 1. **Clustering Evidence:**\n\nThe K_iso(r) curve consistently lies above the K_pois(r) curve, indicating significant clustering of conflict events at all spatial scales. This means that the conflict events are not randomly distributed, but rather exhibit concentrations in specific areas. The clustering suggests that conflict events are more likely to occur near one another, hinting at the influence of underlying geographic, political, or social factors that create these clusters.\n\n#### 2. **Scale-Dependent Clustering:**\n\nThe increasing divergence between K_iso(r) and K_pois(r) as distance (r) increases highlights that the intensity of clustering becomes more pronounced at larger scales. At shorter distances, localized clusters may represent hotspots of conflict within a limited area. As the scale increases, the divergence indicates that these clusters are not isolated but may be part of broader regional conflict zones, indicating an extensive conflict network across the country.\n\n#### 3. **Non-Stationarity:**\n\nThe continuous upward trend in both the K_iso(r) and K_pois(r) curves, without leveling off, suggests that the spatial process driving the conflict events is non-stationary. In other words, the distribution and intensity of conflicts vary significantly across different regions of Myanmar. This non-stationarity implies that conflict dynamics are influenced by regional factors, such as the presence of specific ethnic groups, political boundaries, or military operations, which change across space.\n\n#### 4. **Intensity of Clustering:**\n\nThe steep slope of the K_iso(r) curve compared to the K_pois(r) curve reflects the high intensity of clustering. This suggests that certain areas experienced significantly higher concentrations of conflict events than others, indicating focal points of violence or strategic regions where conflicts have been concentrated. The intensity might also reflect areas with continuous, prolonged violence.\n\n#### 5. **Large-Scale Patterns:**\n\nThe persistence of clustering at large distances, up to 225,000 units (likely meters), indicates that the conflict has a broad spatial footprint. This suggests that conflicts are not only localized but also spread across vast regions, potentially linking disparate conflict zones. The spatial reach of these patterns points to an interconnected conflict dynamic, where events in one region may influence or are connected to events in far-flung areas.\n\n#### 6. **Implications for Conflict Dynamics:**\n\n-   **Strategic or Ethnic Concentration:** The clustering pattern suggests that conflict events are concentrated around certain strategic areas, possibly reflecting ethnic territories, resource-rich zones, or locations with political or military significance.\n\n-   **Conflict Diffusion:** The increasing divergence at larger distances might indicate the spread of conflict from one region to neighboring regions over time, potentially as a result of insurgencies, military operations, or population movements.\n\n-   **Non-Randomness:** The non-random nature of the conflict distribution highlights underlying structural drivers, such as ethnic tensions, resource competition, or political grievances, which shape the spatial arrangement of conflict.\n\n#### 7. **Methodological Considerations:**\n\nThe use of K_iso(r) in this analysis suggests that isotropy corrections were applied. Isotropy assumes that the spatial process behaves similarly in all directions. By accounting for directional biases in the data, the analysis provides a more robust and reliable understanding of the conflict’s spatial patterns. This is crucial in regions like Myanmar, where geographical features or political boundaries may introduce directional influences on conflict events.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe Ripley’s K function analysis reveals that conflict events in Myanmar during Q3 2021 exhibit significant spatial clustering, with clustering becoming more intense at larger spatial scales. The non-stationarity of the process and the persistence of clustering over large areas suggest that conflict is highly concentrated around key locations and may spread regionally. These findings underscore the importance of geographically targeted strategies for conflict resolution, peacekeeping efforts, and policy interventions. By identifying conflict hotspots and understanding the scale-dependent nature of clustering, decision-makers can develop more effective approaches to conflict management and resource allocation in Myanmar.\n\nFurther integration of spatial analysis with temporal trends, conflict typologies, and socio-political variables will provide a more comprehensive understanding of Myanmar’s conflict dynamics, facilitating more informed and strategic decision-making in this complex environment.\n\n# Plotting quarterly KDE layers\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Unique quarters\nquarters <- unique(conflict_filtered$quarter)\n\n# Define and apply the projected CRS\nutm_crs <- st_crs(32647)  # UTM Zone 48N\npar(mfcol=c(2,3))\nfor (q in quarters) {\n   # Filter data for the current quarter\n  conflict_q <- conflict_filtered %>% \n    filter(quarter == q)\n  # Add jitter to the longitude and latitude to avoid duplicated points\nconflict_q <- conflict_q %>% \n  mutate(jittered_longitude = jitter(longitude, factor = 0.0001),\n         jittered_latitude = jitter(latitude, factor = 0.0001))\n\n# Convert to sf object using jittered coordinates\nconflict_sf_q <- st_as_sf(conflict_q, coords = c(\"jittered_longitude\", \"jittered_latitude\"), crs = 4326)\n  \n  # Transform to projected CRS\n  conflict_sf_q_projected <- st_transform(conflict_sf_q, crs = utm_crs)\n  \n  # Convert boundary data to projected CRS and to owin object\n  #boundary_data_projected <- st_transform(boundary_data, crs = utm_crs)\n  #boundary_win <- as.owin(st_as_sf(boundary_data_projected))\n  \n  # Clip the jittered points to the boundary data\nconflict_sf_q_projected <- st_intersection(conflict_sf_q_projected, boundary_data_projected)\n  \n  # Extract coordinates and convert to ppp object\n  coords <- st_coordinates(conflict_sf_q_projected)\n  conflict_ppp_q <- ppp(x = coords[,1], y = coords[,2], window = boundary_win)\n  \n  # Compute KDE\n  kde <- density.ppp(conflict_ppp_q, sigma = bw.diggle)\n  \n  # Plot KDE with tmap\n plot(kde, main = paste(\"KDE for\", q))\n  \n  \n  \n}\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nWarning: attribute variables are assumed to be spatially constant throughout\nall geometries\nWarning: attribute variables are assumed to be spatially constant throughout\nall geometries\nWarning: attribute variables are assumed to be spatially constant throughout\nall geometries\nWarning: attribute variables are assumed to be spatially constant throughout\nall geometries\nWarning: attribute variables are assumed to be spatially constant throughout\nall geometries\nWarning: attribute variables are assumed to be spatially constant throughout\nall geometries\nWarning: attribute variables are assumed to be spatially constant throughout\nall geometries\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](take_home_ex1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-16-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nWarning: attribute variables are assumed to be spatially constant throughout\nall geometries\nWarning: attribute variables are assumed to be spatially constant throughout\nall geometries\nWarning: attribute variables are assumed to be spatially constant throughout\nall geometries\nWarning: attribute variables are assumed to be spatially constant throughout\nall geometries\nWarning: attribute variables are assumed to be spatially constant throughout\nall geometries\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](take_home_ex1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-16-2.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Preparing data for quarterly KDE\n\n-   **`quarters <- unique(conflict_filtered$quarter)`**\n\n    -   This line extracts the unique values from the `quarter` column in the `conflict_filtered` dataset and stores them in the variable `quarters`.\n\n    -   `unique()` is a function that returns only the distinct values from a given vector or column, so this line is essentially finding all the unique quarters present in your data.\n\n-   **`utm_crs <- st_crs(32647)`**\n\n    -   This line defines a coordinate reference system (CRS) using the `st_crs()` function from the `sf` package in R.\n\n    -   `32647` refers to UTM Zone 48N, which is a specific coordinate system used for mapping and spatial analysis. The `st_crs()` function is used to assign this CRS to spatial objects in your analysis.\n\n    -   `utm_crs` is being assigned this CRS so it can be applied to spatial data to ensure proper alignment and analysis.\n\n-   **`par(mfcol=c(2,3))`**\n\n    -   This line is setting up the plotting area for your graphics.\n\n    -   `par(mfcol=c(2,3))` specifies that the plotting area should be divided into a 2x3 grid (2 rows and 3 columns) of panels for displaying multiple plots.\n\n    -   This allows you to create multiple plots in one view, making it easier to compare different visualizations side-by-side.\n\n<!-- -->\n\n-   **`for (q in quarters)`**\n\n    -   This line initiates a `for` loop that iterates over each unique value in the `quarters` vector.\n\n    -   `q` is a loop variable that takes on the value of each unique quarter in turn.\n\n-   **`conflict_q <- conflict_filtered %>% filter(quarter == q)`**\n\n    -   Inside the loop, this line filters the `conflict_filtered` dataset to include only the rows where the `quarter` column matches the current value of `q`.\n\n    -   `%>%` is the pipe operator from the `dplyr` package, which allows for chaining operations. In this case, it is used to pass the `conflict_filtered` dataset to the `filter()` function.\n\n    -   `filter(quarter == q)` is a `dplyr` function that selects rows from `conflict_filtered` where the `quarter` column equals the current quarter value (`q`).\n\n    -   `conflict_q` is a new variable that contains this filtered subset of the data for the current quarter.\n\n**`mutate()` Function:**\n\n-   **`jittered_longitude = jitter(longitude, factor = 0.0001)`**\n\n    -   **`jitter(longitude, factor = 0.0001)`**: Applies the `jitter` function to the `longitude` column. The `factor = 0.0001` specifies a very small amount of noise to add, which spreads out points slightly.\n\n    -   **`jittered_longitude`**: The new column name where the jittered values will be stored.\n\n-   **`jittered_latitude = jitter(latitude, factor = 0.0001)`**\n\n    -   **`jitter(latitude, factor = 0.0001)`**: Similar to the longitude, this adds jitter to the `latitude` column.\n\n    -   **`jittered_latitude`**: The new column name where the jittered latitude values will be stored.\n\n-   **Magnitude of Jitter:**\n\n    -   The `factor` parameter in the `jitter()` function controls the amount of random noise added to your data. A smaller factor (like `0.0001`) results in minimal jitter, while a larger factor increases the amount of noise.\n\n    -   For geographic coordinates, which are often measured in degrees, a very small factor is used to avoid significantly altering the positions while still making slight adjustments to avoid overlapping points.\n\n-   **Scale of Data:**\n\n    -   Geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) are typically measured in decimal degrees. In this context, `0.0001` degrees is a small enough value to make minor adjustments without distorting the geographic locations significantly.\n\n    -   For example, `0.0001` degrees of latitude or longitude is approximately equal to about 10 meters at the equator. This level of jitter is generally sufficient to visually separate closely spaced points without having a noticeable impact on their relative positions.\n\n-   **Precision and Clarity:**\n\n    -   When dealing with precise spatial data, such as GPS coordinates, it’s important to apply just enough jitter to improve visualization or analysis without introducing misleading inaccuracies.\n\n    -   A factor of `0.0001` provides a balance between enough jitter to differentiate points and maintaining the precision of the original data\n\n**`st_intersection()` Function:**\n\n-   **Inputs:**\n\n    -   `conflict_sf_q_projected`: The spatial points with jitter applied.\n\n    -   `boundary_data_projected`: The spatial boundary or polygon that defines the area of interest.\n\n-   **Operation:** `st_intersection()` calculates the geometric intersection between the points and the boundary. Points outside the boundary are discarded, and only those within the boundary are kept.\n\n-   **Result:** `conflict_sf_q_projected` is updated to include only those points that lie within the boundary.\n\n**Extracting Coordinates:**\n\n-   **`st_coordinates()` Function:** This function extracts the coordinates from the `sf` object. It returns a matrix with columns for the x (longitude) and y (latitude) coordinates.\n\n-   **Result:** `coords` is a matrix where `coords[,1]` contains the x-coordinates and `coords[,2]` contains the y-coordinates of the points within the boundary.\n\n**Converting to `ppp` Object:**\n\n-   **Arguments:**\n\n    -   `x = coords[,1]`: The x-coordinates (longitudes) of the points.\n\n    -   `y = coords[,2]`: The y-coordinates (latitudes) of the points.\n\n    -   `window = boundary_win`: Defines the spatial window or boundary within which the points are analyzed. This should be a `psp` or `owin` object representing the area of interest.\n\n-   **Result:** `conflict_ppp_q` is a `ppp` object that represents the spatial pattern of points within the defined boundary. This object is used for further spatial analysis and modeling.\n\n## **Compute KDE**\n\n**`density.ppp()` Function:**\n\n-   **Purpose:** Computes the Kernel Density Estimate of point patterns. KDE is used to estimate the intensity (or density) of points in a spatial domain.\n\n-   **Arguments:**\n\n    -   `conflict_ppp_q`: The `ppp` object containing your spatial point data within the boundary.\n\n    -   `sigma = bw.diggle`: Specifies the bandwidth for the KDE. `bw.diggle` is often a bandwidth parameter computed using methods such as Diggle’s method for optimal bandwidth selection. It controls the smoothness of the density estimate. A smaller bandwidth results in a more detailed but noisier density estimate, while a larger bandwidth provides a smoother, more generalized estimate.\n\n-   **Result:** `kde` is an object representing the KDE of your point pattern, which can be visualized as a spatial density map.\n\n## Understanding Quarterly KDE layers\n\nThe Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) maps provide valuable insights into the evolving spatial patterns of armed conflict events in Myanmar over various time periods. The analysis of these maps highlights both persistent and fluctuating trends, along with temporal and regional variations. Below is a detailed analysis of the spatial distribution of armed conflict events, organized by key observations and specific time periods.\n\n### **Overall Observations for 2021 Q3 - 2022 Q4**\n\n#### **Persistent Hotspots:**\n\nSeveral regions in Myanmar exhibit consistently high densities of armed conflict events across the time periods analyzed. Notably, the northern regions, particularly Kachin and Shan states, remain hotspots for conflict, as do areas near the western border with Bangladesh. These areas have maintained significant conflict activity throughout the periods, indicating entrenched issues that persist over time.\n\n#### **Fluctuations in Conflict Intensity:**\n\nAlthough these regions continue to experience conflict, the intensity and concentration of events within them vary across quarters. Some periods exhibit more concentrated clusters, while others show a more dispersed distribution, reflecting the changing dynamics of conflict on the ground.\n\n### **Specific Time Periods (2021-2022)**\n\n#### **2021 Q3 and Q4:**\n\nDuring the latter half of 2021, the maps reveal a high concentration of conflict events in the northern part of Myanmar, particularly in Kachin and Shan states. In addition, significant clusters are observed in the western region, near the Bangladesh border, reflecting localized tensions and conflict in these areas.\n\n#### **2022 Q1 and Q2:**\n\nIn the first half of 2022, there is a slight reduction in the overall intensity of conflict compared to 2021. However, the northern and western regions remain primary hotspots. The spatial distribution of conflict events appears to be more dispersed in certain areas, suggesting a shift in conflict dynamics or potential de-escalation in some regions while conflict persists in others.\n\n#### **2022 Q3 and Q4:**\n\nBy the second half of 2022, the maps indicate a resurgence of conflict, particularly in Kachin state, where a high density of events is observed. The western region near the Bangladesh border also continues to experience conflict, although fluctuations in intensity are evident.\n\n### **Additional Geographic and Regional Observations:**\n\n#### **Influence of Geographic Features:**\n\nThe spatial patterns of conflict may be influenced by Myanmar’s geographic features, such as mountainous terrain and river systems. These natural barriers can impact the movement of armed groups and the distribution of conflict events, potentially contributing to the clustering of events in certain areas while others remain less affected.\n\n#### **Border Dynamics and Neighboring Countries:**\n\nThe proximity of Myanmar to its neighbors, particularly China and India, may also influence conflict dynamics, especially in border regions. Cross-border activities, such as arms smuggling or external support to local armed groups, could shape the spatial distribution of events in regions like northern Myanmar.\n\n### **Overall Observations for 2023 Q1 - 2024 Q2**\n\n#### **Overall Density Trends:**\n\nThe KDE maps for 2023 and 2024 highlight a shift in the overall distribution of conflict, with a noticeable concentration of events in central Myanmar and the southern regions.\n\n-   **2024-Q2:** The highest densities are observed in central and southern Myanmar, with a gradual decrease toward the northern and eastern borders.\n\n-   **2023-Q4:** Similar patterns are observed, with central and southern regions continuing to experience the highest densities.\n\n-   **2023-Q2 and Q3:** There is a more dispersed distribution of conflict events, although the central region still maintains higher densities compared to other parts of the country.\n\n#### **Temporal Variations and Shifts in Density:**\n\nA comparison across time periods reveals several notable trends:\n\n-   **2023 Q1 to 2023 Q4:** Conflict density appears to have increased in the central region between these two quarters, indicating an escalation of violence or conflict activity in this area.\n\n-   **2023 Q2 to 2023 Q3:** The density shifts slightly, with potential increases observed in the southern region and a corresponding decrease in central Myanmar, highlighting fluctuations in the concentration of conflict over time.\n\n-   **2024 Q1 to 2024 Q2:** A resurgence of conflict in the central region is evident, with an increase in density between these two quarters.\n\n### **Key Observations Across the Entire Study Period (2021 Q3 - 2024 Q2):**\n\n#### **Persistence of Regional Hotspots:**\n\nDespite fluctuations in conflict intensity, certain regions—such as Kachin, Shan, and the western border near Bangladesh—remain consistent hotspots for conflict. This persistence suggests deep-rooted, unresolved issues driving ongoing violence in these areas.\n\n#### **Temporal Fluctuations in Conflict Density:**\n\nWhile the overall spatial distribution of armed conflict in Myanmar remains dynamic, the analysis shows that conflict intensity can wax and wane within the same regions over time. The maps from 2021 Q3 to 2024 Q2 reveal periods of relative de-escalation, followed by resurgences of violence, particularly in central and northern Myanmar.\n\n#### **Clustering and Dispersal Patterns:**\n\nThe KDE maps demonstrate that armed conflict events tend to cluster in certain regions, notably the central and southern parts of the country in more recent periods (2023-2024). This clustering may indicate increased activity in these regions, while more dispersed patterns in earlier periods suggest fluctuating control or movement of conflict across wider areas.\n\n#### **Impact of Geography and Neighboring Influence:**\n\nGeographic features, such as mountains and rivers, likely play a role in shaping the conflict landscape by influencing the movement and concentration of armed groups. Additionally, the impact of cross-border dynamics, particularly with China, India, and Bangladesh, may also contribute to the spatial distribution of conflict, especially in northern and western regions\n\n# Plotting quarterly 2nd order Spatial Point Pattern\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npar(mfcol=c(2,4))\nfor (q in quarters) {\n  # Filter data for the current quarter\n  conflict_q <- conflict_filtered %>% \n    filter(quarter == q)\n  \n  # Add jitter to the longitude and latitude to avoid duplicated points\n  conflict_q <- conflict_q %>% \n    mutate(jittered_longitude = jitter(longitude, factor = 0.0001),\n           jittered_latitude = jitter(latitude, factor = 0.0001))\n\n  # Convert to sf object using jittered coordinates\n  conflict_sf_q <- st_as_sf(conflict_q, coords = c(\"jittered_longitude\", \"jittered_latitude\"), crs = 4326)\n  \n  # Transform to projected CRS\n  conflict_sf_q_projected <- st_transform(conflict_sf_q, crs = utm_crs)\n  \n  # Convert boundary data to projected CRS and to owin object\n  boundary_data_projected <- st_transform(boundary_data, crs = utm_crs)\n  boundary_win <- as.owin(st_as_sf(boundary_data_projected))\n  \n  # Clip the jittered points to the boundary data\n  conflict_sf_q_projected <- st_intersection(conflict_sf_q_projected, boundary_data_projected)\n  \n  # Extract coordinates and convert to ppp object\n  coords <- st_coordinates(conflict_sf_q_projected)\n  conflict_ppp_q <- ppp(x = coords[,1], y = coords[,2], window = boundary_win)\n  \n  # Compute K-function\n  K_result <- Kest(conflict_ppp_q, correction = \"border\")\n  \n  # Plot the K-function\n  plot(K_result, main = paste(\"K-function for\", q), legend = FALSE)\n  \n  # Optionally, add theoretical vs. observed plot lines (e.g., K-Function minus CSR)\n  plot(K_result, . - r ~ r, main = paste(\"K-test deviation for\", q))\n}\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nWarning: attribute variables are assumed to be spatially constant throughout\nall geometries\nWarning: attribute variables are assumed to be spatially constant throughout\nall geometries\nWarning: attribute variables are assumed to be spatially constant throughout\nall geometries\nWarning: attribute variables are assumed to be spatially constant throughout\nall geometries\nWarning: attribute variables are assumed to be spatially constant throughout\nall geometries\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](take_home_ex1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-17-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nWarning: attribute variables are assumed to be spatially constant throughout\nall geometries\nWarning: attribute variables are assumed to be spatially constant throughout\nall geometries\nWarning: attribute variables are assumed to be spatially constant throughout\nall geometries\nWarning: attribute variables are assumed to be spatially constant throughout\nall geometries\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](take_home_ex1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-17-2.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nWarning: attribute variables are assumed to be spatially constant throughout\nall geometries\nWarning: attribute variables are assumed to be spatially constant throughout\nall geometries\nWarning: attribute variables are assumed to be spatially constant throughout\nall geometries\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](take_home_ex1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-17-3.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Understanding quarterly 2nd order Spatial Point Pattern\n\nThe K-function plots offer detailed insights into the spatial clustering of conflict events by examining how points (conflict events) are distributed within a given distance (r) from each other. The following analysis explores the results across four quarters and highlights key patterns, clustering trends, and statistical significance.\n\n#### **K-Function Results by Quarter**\n\n-   **Q1 and Q2**: The K-function curve consistently lies above the expected value for complete spatial randomness (CSR) across all distances, indicating a strong and persistent clustering pattern. At both small and large spatial scales, the clustering of conflict events remains significant, with little evidence of randomness in the spatial distribution.\n\n-   **Q3 and Q4**: A similar clustering pattern is observed at smaller distances, where the K-function curve remains above the expected value, confirming the concentration of conflict events in localized areas. However, at larger distances, the curve gradually approaches the expected value, suggesting a more random distribution as the spatial scale increases.\n\n### **K-Test Deviation Analysis**\n\n-   **Q1 and Q2**: The K-test deviation plots, which measure the statistical significance of the observed clustering, show strong deviations from zero across all distances. These significant deviations reinforce the clustering pattern identified in the K-function plots, with consistent clustering across both small and large distances.\n\n-   **Q3 and Q4**: While the K-test deviation curves show significant clustering at smaller distances, the deviations become less pronounced at larger distances. This reflects a spatial pattern where clustering is more intense in localized areas but disperses slightly at broader scales.\n\n### **Key Findings**\n\n#### **Clustering Patterns**:\n\n-   Across all four quarters, the K-function plots reveal a consistent pattern of spatial clustering. This is especially pronounced in Q1 and Q2, where the clustering remains strong across all distances. Q3 and Q4 show a more complex pattern, with clustering at smaller scales but a tendency toward randomness at larger distances.\n\n#### **Temporal Variation**:\n\n-   Though clustering is observed in all quarters, the intensity and extent of clustering vary slightly over time. The earlier quarters (Q1 and Q2) show stronger, more uniform clustering, while the later quarters (Q3 and Q4) display a more dispersed pattern as distance increases.\n\n#### **Statistical Significance**:\n\n-   The K-test deviation plots consistently show significant deviations from zero, providing statistical confirmation of the clustering observed in the K-function plots. These deviations are particularly strong at smaller distances, indicating that conflict events are more likely to cluster locally rather than occur randomly across the study area.\n\n### **Temporal Trends and Scale of Clustering**\n\n#### **Consistency Over Time**:\n\nThe overall structure of the conflict remains stable across the analyzed quarters, with persistent clustering observed in all periods. This suggests that the spatial distribution of conflict events has not undergone significant changes from 2021 to 2023, reflecting entrenched conflict dynamics that continue to drive the spatial concentration of violence.\n\n#### **Clustering at Multiple Scales**:\n\nThe clustering observed in the K-function plots is evident at various spatial scales, extending up to 150,000 units (likely meters or kilometers). At larger scales, the increasing divergence between the observed and expected K-functions suggests that clustering becomes more pronounced over broader geographic regions. This highlights that conflict is not just localized but affects larger swathes of territory.\n\n### **Spatial Non-Stationarity and Conflict Intensity**\n\n-   **Non-Stationarity**: The continuous upward trend of the K-functions across all distances indicates spatial non-stationarity in the conflict. This means that the intensity and distribution of conflict events vary across different regions of Myanmar, with no clear point where the conflict stabilizes spatially.\n\n-   **Conflict Intensity**: The steepness of the observed K-function curves, particularly in the early quarters (Q1 and Q2), suggests a high intensity of clustering. This indicates that conflict events are concentrated in specific areas rather than being randomly or evenly distributed throughout the country.\n\n### **Implications for Conflict Analysis**\n\n#### **Stable Conflict Hotspots**:\n\nThe persistent clustering identified in the K-function and K-test deviation plots points to stable conflict hotspots over time. These regions of concentrated conflict are likely driven by long-standing factors, such as ethnic divisions, strategic resource locations, or political tensions, that continue to fuel violence.\n\n#### **Targeting Intervention Efforts**:\n\nThe identification of consistent spatial clustering can help policymakers, humanitarian organizations, and peacekeeping missions in Myanmar target their intervention efforts more effectively. By focusing on these stable hotspots, resources can be allocated to the areas that require the most attention, reducing conflict intensity and alleviating the humanitarian impact in these regions.\n\n#### **Sustained, Long-Term Approaches**:\n\nThe consistent spatial structure of conflict over time suggests that short-term interventions may not be sufficient to address the root causes of violence. Instead, sustained, targeted efforts are necessary to address the deeply entrenched conflict dynamics that persist across Myanmar’s regions\n\n# Preparing Data for Spatial Temporal KDE\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nconflict_sf_spatemp<-conflict_sf_projected %>% \n  mutate(DayofYear = yday(event_date)) %>% \n  mutate(Month_num = month(event_date))\n```\n:::\n\n\n-   **`mutate(DayofYear = yday(event_date))`**:\n\n    -   This creates a new column `DayofYear` that converts each event's `event_date` into a numeric value representing the day of the year (from 1 to 365 or 366 in a leap year).\n\n    -   In spatial-temporal KDE, time is treated as a continuous dimension. Converting the event dates into day-of-year values allows you to model temporal variation across the calendar year in a continuous format. It helps identify patterns tied to specific times of the year, such as seasonal effects or yearly trends in conflict events.\n\n-   **`mutate(Month_num = month(event_date))`**:\n\n    -   This adds another column `Month_num` that extracts the month number from each event's `event_date` (values from 1 for January to 12 for December).\n\n    -   Depending on the level of temporal granularity you wish to analyze, having the month number can be useful for grouping or summarizing events by months. While day-of-year is more granular, the month number allows for coarser temporal patterns, such as monthly trends or seasonal variations.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nconflict_sf_spatemp_month<-conflict_sf_spatemp %>% \n  dplyr::select(Month_num)\n```\n:::\n\n\n**`dplyr::select(Month_num)`**: This function selects only the `Month_num` column from the `conflict_sf_spatemp` dataset.

This is consistent with historical trends of conflict occurring in ethnic minority areas, such as the northern, eastern, and western parts of the country, where separatist or insurgent movements are more active.\n\n-   **Low Intensity in Central Plains**: The central plains, including the capital region (likely Naypyidaw), show consistently low conflict intensity throughout the 12-month period. This may reflect the central region's relative stability due to stronger government control and less ethnic fragmentation compared to the border regions.\n\n#### **Temporal Evolution**\n\n-   **Months 1-11**: The conflict patterns remain relatively stable, with minor fluctuations in intensity. These fluctuations are seen primarily in the northern, eastern, and western regions, where conflict tends to concentrate, but there are no significant shifts in the overall spatial distribution.\n\n-   **Month 12**: A notable escalation occurs in the final month, with a significant increase in conflict intensity, especially in the northern and eastern border regions. This spike in conflict could suggest a surge in fighting, possibly tied to political, military, or ethnic tensions intensifying.\n\n#### **Hotspots**\n\n-   **Northern Region (Likely Kachin State)**: Throughout the 12-month period, the northern region consistently exhibits high conflict intensity. Kachin State, home to various insurgent groups, has long been a hotspot for ethnic conflict and military operations.\n\n-   **Eastern Region (Possibly Shan State)**: The eastern border region, possibly Shan State, shows persistent conflict presence. This area has been affected by multiple armed groups, making it another key hotspot of protracted conflict.\n\n-   **Western Region (Potentially Rakhine State)**: The western region experiences moderate conflict intensity, fluctuating over time. Rakhine State has a history of both ethnic violence and military confrontations, although the intensity appears lower and more variable compared to Kachin and Shan states.\n\n#### **Changes in Conflict Intensity**\n\n-   **Color Scale Interpretation**: The KDE maps use a color gradient to represent conflict intensity, with darker blues indicating lower density and pinks/reds signifying higher density. These color changes highlight the concentration and spread of conflict zones across Myanmar.\n\n-   **Localized High-Intensity Zones**: Most of the earlier months (1-11) display smaller areas of red/pink, representing localized high-intensity conflict zones. These zones are typically confined to border areas and insurgent hotspots.\n\n-   **Expansion in Month 12**: Month 12 shows a considerable expansion of high-intensity conflict zones, with more areas transitioning to pink/red. This expansion could indicate an escalation of conflict, broader mobilization of armed groups, or increased government military action in these regions.\n\n#### **Geographical Influences**\n\n-   **Ethnic Diversity and Conflict**: The conflict pattern follows Myanmar's ethnically diverse and politically volatile border regions. These areas are home to various ethnic minorities who have historically engaged in armed struggle for autonomy or independence. The persistence of conflict in these regions suggests that ethnic tensions and separatist movements are key drivers of the violence.\n\n-   **Government Control in Central Region**: The central region's relative peace likely corresponds to stronger government control and the absence of insurgent movements. This region, with its concentration of administrative and military infrastructure, may enjoy a higher level of security and stability compared to the less-governed border areas.\n\n### **Key Takeaways**\n\n1.  **Stable Hotspots**: The northern, eastern, and western regions, particularly Kachin, Shan, and Rakhine states, remain persistent conflict hotspots. These areas have been historically prone to insurgency, and their continued presence as conflict zones indicates long-standing and unresolved ethnic tensions.\n\n2.  **Conflict Escalation**: The spike in conflict intensity in month 12 suggests an escalation in violence, possibly triggered by shifting political dynamics, increased insurgent activity, or military offensives. This sudden expansion in high-intensity zones underscores the volatile nature of Myanmar's conflict landscape.\n\n3.  **Strategic Stability in the Central Plains**: The central region, likely benefiting from stronger governmental presence and infrastructure, remains largely unaffected by the conflict. This division between the periphery and the center reflects the uneven nature of state control and the concentration of conflict in ethnically diverse border areas.\n\n### **Implications for Conflict Resolution and Humanitarian Intervention**\n\n-   **Focus on Hotspots**: Given the persistence of conflict in the northern, eastern, and western regions, any peace-building or conflict resolution efforts should prioritize these areas. Ethnic grievances and the demand for autonomy are likely key factors driving the conflict in these regions.\n\n-   **Monitoring Escalation**: The significant uptick in conflict intensity in month 12 suggests that monitoring trends in violence is critical for predicting and preventing further escalations. International actors and local stakeholders must remain vigilant to shifts in the conflict landscape.\n\n-   **Long-Term Stability in the Center**: The stability of the central region may serve as a model for extending government control and peace to the periphery, although this will require careful navigation of ethnic tensions and historical grievances.\n\n# Perform 2nd-Order Spatio-temporal Point Patterns Analysis\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Calculate spatio-temporal K-function\nK_st <- Kest(conflict_sf_spatemp_ppp, correction = \"border\")\n\n# Plot the spatio-temporal K-function\nplot(K_st, main = \"Spatio-temporal K-function\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](take_home_ex1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-24-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Key Observations and Interpretations:\n\n1.  **Conflict Clustering**: The *K_bord(r)* function (solid black line) consistently being above the *K_pois(r)* function (dashed red line) indicates significant clustering of conflict events in Myanmar. This means that violence is concentrated in specific areas, rather than being randomly distributed or spread evenly across the country. Such clustering suggests the existence of conflict hotspots driven by specific factors, such as geographic, political, or ethnic tensions.\n\n2.  **Scale of Clustering**: As the distance increases, the gap between *K_bord(r)* and *K_pois(r)* widens, indicating that clustering becomes more pronounced at larger scales. This implies that regional conflict zones are not confined to small, isolated areas but are instead part of broader geographic patterns. Large-scale clustering could suggest that conflicts are regionally interconnected, with violence spreading beyond localized zones.\n\n3.  **Persistent Clustering**: The continuous upward trajectory of *K_bord(r)*, without leveling off, shows that the clustering of conflict events persists even at larger distances (up to 120,000 units, likely kilometers). This suggests that the conflict has a widespread spatial reach, potentially affecting large portions of Myanmar. The lack of stabilization implies that these clusters are not limited to small regions but extend across significant geographic areas.\n\n4.  **Intensity Variation**: The steeper slope of the *K_bord(r)* curve compared to *K_pois(r)* indicates significant variation in the intensity of conflict events across different regions. Some areas experience much higher concentrations of conflict than others. These intense conflict zones may be driven by underlying factors such as resource competition, ethnic tensions, or military strategies.\n\n5.  **Conflict Diffusion**: The growing gap between *K_bord(r)* and *K_pois(r)* at larger distances suggests a diffusion effect. Conflict in one area appears to influence, or spread to, neighboring regions over time. This pattern of diffusion could indicate a contagion-like effect, where violence escalates and spreads due to interconnected grievances or strategic military movements.\n\n6.  **Non-Stationarity**: The absence of stabilization in the *K*-functions at larger distances highlights the non-stationary nature of the conflict. This suggests that spatial patterns of violence in Myanmar are dynamic, evolving over time or varying across different regions. The lack of a clear boundary for conflict clustering indicates that the process is fluid, with shifting fronts of violence depending on changing factors such as political developments, military operations, or ethnic mobilization.\n\n7.  **Complex Spatial Dynamics**: The increasing slope of the *K_bord(r)* function indicates complex spatial dynamics within the conflict. Factors such as terrain, ethnic distributions, resource locations, and strategic military objectives likely shape where and how conflict clusters develop. The complexity of these dynamics requires careful analysis to understand the root causes and potential solutions for violence.\n\n### Implications for Conflict Analysis in Myanmar:\n\n1.  **Hotspot Identification**: The analysis demonstrates that conflict events are not random, enabling analysts to focus on identifying specific hotspots of violence. By understanding these clusters, policymakers and peace negotiators can prioritize areas for intervention, aid distribution, or peacebuilding efforts.\n\n2.  **Conflict Prediction**: The persistent clustering observed at various scales suggests that predictive models could be developed to forecast potential spread or escalation of conflict. By analyzing where conflict zones are likely to emerge or intensify, analysts can provide early warnings and allocate resources to mitigate future violence.\n\n3.  **Understanding Spatial Dynamics**: This spatio-temporal analysis provides a quantitative foundation for understanding the complex dynamics of conflict in Myanmar. Insights from this analysis are critical for policymakers, humanitarian organizations, and peace negotiators working in the region, as they highlight the importance of addressing both localized and regional drivers of conflict.\n\n4.  **Targeted Interventions**: Given the clear clustering and diffusion patterns, interventions could be tailored to specific regions most affected by the conflict. Understanding where and how violence spreads allows for more strategic deployment of peacekeeping forces, humanitarian aid, and conflict resolution efforts.\n\n5.  **Long-Term Planning**: The non-stationary nature of the conflict underscores the need for adaptable, long-term solutions. Conflict dynamics in Myanmar are not static, meaning any efforts to resolve violence must account for shifting patterns of violence over time and across different regions.\n\nIn conclusion, the clustering of conflict events, diffusion of violence, and the non-stationary nature of the conflict in Myanmar reveal the need for targeted, adaptable interventions. This spatio-temporal analysis offers critical insights for developing effective conflict resolution strategies tailored to Myanmar's complex and evolving conflict landscape.\n\n# Preparing Data for Daily Spatial Temporal KDE\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nconflict_sf_spatemp_day<-conflict_sf_spatemp %>% \n  dplyr::select(DayofYear)\n```\n:::\n\n\n**`dplyr::select(DayofYear)`**: This function selects only the DayofYearcolumn from the `conflict_sf_spatemp` dataset.

It ensures that if an error occurs while generating the plot for a particular day, the error is caught and handled, and the process continues for the next day.\n\n    -   The `finally` block ensures that the plotting device is closed (via `dev.off()`) even if an error occurs.\n\n-   `png(filename = png_filename)`:\n\n    -   This function opens a PNG graphics device, directing any subsequent plotting commands to be saved to the PNG file specified by `png_filename`.\n\n-   `plot(day_kde, tselect = i, ...)`:\n\n    -   This generates the actual plot for day `i`.\n\n    -   `day_kde` is likely a kernel density estimate object, and `tselect = i` specifies that the plot should show the KDE for the specific day `i`.\n\n    -   `override.par = FALSE` and `fix.range = TRUE` are additional parameters controlling the appearance of the plot, possibly related to plot scaling or styling.\n\n    -   `main = paste(\"KDE at day\", i)` sets the plot title dynamically, showing \"KDE at day X\" for each day `i`.\n\n-   `title(xlab = \"X\", ylab = \"Y\")`:\n\n    -   This adds labels to the X and Y axes of the plot.\n\n-   `dev.off()`:\n\n    -   This function closes the PNG graphics device, saving the plot to the file. The `dev.off()` command is placed inside the `finally` block to ensure it runs regardless of whether the plot generation succeeds or fails.\n\n-   `error = function(e) { message(\"Error generating frame \", i, \": \", e$message) }`:\n\n    -   If an error occurs while generating the plot for a particular day, this function captures the error and prints a message indicating which frame failed, along with the error message.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nframe_files <- list.files(temp_dir, pattern = \"*.png\", full.names = TRUE)\n# Create the animation from the frames using magick\nframe_images <- image_read(frame_files)\nanimation <- image_animate(frame_images, fps = 100)\n\n# Save the animation as a GIF\ngif_filename <- \"spattemp_kde_day.gif\"\nimage_write(animation, gif_filename)\n```\n:::\n\n\nIt uses the `magick` package in R to read the image files, combine them into an animation, and then save the animation as a GIF. Here's a breakdown:\n\n1.  `frame_files <- list.files(temp_dir, pattern = \"*.png\", full.names = TRUE)`:\n\n    -   This line retrieves a list of all the PNG image files in the directory specified by `temp_dir`.\n\n    -   `pattern = \"*.png\"` ensures that only files with a `.png` extension are selected.\n\n    -   `full.names = TRUE` ensures that the full file path of each image is returned (not just the filenames), which is necessary for reading them later.\n\n2.  `frame_images <- image_read(frame_files)`:\n\n    -   This uses the `image_read()` function from the `magick` package to read in all the PNG files specified in `frame_files` and store them as a list of image objects in `frame_images`.\n\n3.  `animation <- image_animate(frame_images, fps = 100)`:\n\n    -   This creates the animation from the list of image objects (`frame_images`).\n\n    -   `image_animate()` combines the images into an animation with a frame rate of `100 frames per second (fps)`.\n\n4.  `gif_filename <- \"spattemp_kde_day.gif\"`:\n\n    -   This specifies the filename for the animated GIF that will be saved.\n\n5.  `image_write(animation, gif_filename)`:\n\n    -   This saves the animation as a GIF file using the filename specified in `gif_filename` (`\"spattemp_kde_day.gif\"`).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Display the GIF in R's Viewer tab\nbrowsable(tags$img(src = gif_filename))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n```{=html}\n<img src=\"spattemp_kde_day.gif\"/>\n```\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n-   `tags$img(src = gif_filename)` creates an HTML `<img>` tag with the `src` attribute set to the GIF file (`gif_filename`), which points to the location of the generated GIF.\n\n-   `browsable()` wraps the HTML tag so that RStudio’s Viewer tab can render it and display the GIF\n\n## Understanding daily spatio-temporal KDE layers\n\n#### 1. **Spatial Distribution**:\n\nThe provided image displays a Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) heat map, overlaid onto the geographical outline of Myanmar. The KDE method is employed to estimate the spatial distribution of conflict-related events or similar phenomena. The density is represented by a color gradient, where warmer colors (yellow and red) signify regions of higher event density, and cooler colors (blue) indicate lower density areas. This visualization provides a clear representation of how the intensity of events is distributed across the country on a daily basis.\n\n#### 2. **Focal Point**:\n\nA significant concentration of activity is observed in the central region, likely corresponding to a major urban center or strategic area. This hotspot suggests a high density of conflict-related events, indicating that the area could be a focal point for ongoing unrest, military operations, or political turmoil. The concentration of events in this central region could be linked to factors such as political significance, strategic value, or logistical advantages.\n\n#### 3. **Intensity Gradients**:\n\nThe KDE map reveals a radial dispersion pattern, with the highest intensity centered around the aforementioned focal point and gradually diminishing as one moves toward the periphery. This gradient suggests a core-periphery structure to the conflict, where the central region serves as an epicenter, and its effects or related events propagate outward. The decreasing intensity towards the edges could be attributed to logistical constraints, geographical barriers, or diminishing influence as one moves away from the central hotspot.\n\n#### 4. **Regional Variations**:\n\nBeyond the central hotspot, the map shows additional areas of heightened activity in the northern and southeastern regions. These smaller clusters suggest that conflict or event density is not confined to the central area but is also present in other strategic locations. The presence of these secondary hotspots may be linked to local factors, such as ethnic insurgencies, border tensions, or resource-based conflicts, commonly observed in these peripheral regions.\n\n#### 5. **Scale and Interpretation**:\n\nThe legend accompanying the map indicates values ranging from approximately 5e-15 to 3.5e-14, which likely represent probability densities rather than absolute counts of events. In the context of KDE analysis, these values provide insight into the relative concentration of events, with higher values indicating regions with a higher likelihood of conflict occurrence. The small magnitude of these values reflects the probabilistic nature of the KDE technique, which smooths the data to provide a clearer understanding of event distribution across the geographic area.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe daily spatio-temporal KDE map effectively highlights the spatial structure of conflict events in Myanmar. The central region, with its high density of events, emerges as a focal point, suggesting it is a key area of concern. The outward radiating pattern of intensity implies that the conflict has significant regional implications, with potential ripple effects into surrounding areas. Smaller clusters of activity in the northern and southeastern regions further underscore the geographically dispersed nature of the conflict. The KDE map thus provides valuable insights into the spatial dynamics of conflict, offering critical information for strategic planning, resource allocation, and conflict resolution efforts.\n\n# Conclusion & Reflection\n\n### **1. Importance of Geospatial Analysis in Conflict Studies**\n\nThis exercise underscored how geospatial methods can reveal patterns that are often invisible in tabular data. The ability to visualize and analyze armed conflict events spatially and temporally offered a much clearer understanding of the scope and distribution of violence. From detecting the clustering of violence in key regions to observing temporal shifts in conflict zones, the KDE maps provided compelling evidence that allowed for deeper exploration of where and when conflict is concentrated. This kind of analysis can be instrumental in formulating responses, both in terms of immediate humanitarian aid and long-term peacebuilding.\n\n### **2. The Challenges of Working with Conflict Data**\n\nOne of the reflections that emerged was the difficulty of working with conflict data, which often contains missing, duplicate, or imprecise points. In some cases, data points were rejected as they fell outside of defined boundaries, which reminded me of the importance of carefully pre-processing and cleaning the data before running the analysis. Additionally, geospatial data inherently comes with projection challenges, as the transition from geographic to projected coordinate systems is necessary for certain spatial analyses.\n\nThe warnings about duplicated points also illustrated the limitations of relying solely on point data to represent conflict events. Some areas are so saturated with violence that distinct events overlap, making it challenging to separate individual incidents without introducing statistical artifacts. This was a valuable reminder of the need for rigorous data wrangling and methodological precision when working with sensitive and complex datasets.\n\n### **3. The Potential of Geospatial Tools in Policy and Humanitarian Efforts**\n\nThis assignment also highlighted the immense potential of geospatial tools in shaping policy and guiding humanitarian interventions. By identifying hotspots and shifts in conflict intensity over time, this type of analysis can help direct aid to the regions most affected by violence, and in real time, assist governments and international organizations in conflict mitigation efforts. For instance, timely monitoring of violence against civilians could allow for rapid responses to prevent further harm in emerging conflict zones. Moreover, identifying persistent hotspots provides crucial information for peace negotiations or ceasefire agreements that are geographically focused on the most affected areas.\n",
