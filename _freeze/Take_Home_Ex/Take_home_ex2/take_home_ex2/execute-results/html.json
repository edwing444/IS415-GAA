More recently, synthetic drugs like methamphetamine have become prevalent.\n\n-   Thailand serves both as a **transit route** for drugs destined for third countries and as a significant **market** for illicit drugs. This geopolitical factor adds complexity to the issue, as it intersects with international drug trafficking networks and the nation's domestic drug use.\n\n### 2. **Transportation Infrastructure**\n\n-   With the continuous development of transportation infrastructure in Thailand, the movement of drugs becomes easier both within the country and across borders. This infrastructure facilitates not only legitimate commerce but also illegal activities, particularly in regions that border drug-producing areas.\n\n-   Analysts should consider transportation routes and **connectivity** between provinces, as these might correlate with higher rates of drug abuse or trafficking activity in certain regions.\n\n### 3. **Prevalence of Drug Use**\n\n-   Globally, drug use is on the rise, and Thailand reflects this trend. With **2.7 million youths** reportedly using drugs, and **300,000** needing drug treatment, it’s clear that drug abuse is a pervasive social problem.\n\n-   A particular focus should be placed on **youth involvement**, especially among **vocational-school students**, as they show a higher incidence of drug abuse compared to secondary-school students. Analysts may want to explore why this demographic is more vulnerable and how their environment (e.g., educational settings, social circles) contributes to the problem.\n\n### 4. **Health, Financial, and Social Impact**\n\n-   Drug abuse has severe **health consequences**, including addiction, overdose, and the spread of infectious diseases (e.g., HIV, hepatitis).\n\n-   The **financial cost** includes both the economic burden on healthcare systems and the loss of productivity, particularly among the youth. Social consequences may include increased crime rates, family breakdowns, and reduced educational and employment opportunities for affected individuals.\n\n-   **Social services** and the **healthcare system** in Thailand are likely under strain, with increasing demands for drug treatment and rehabilitation programs.\n\n### 5. **Geographic Distribution of Drug Use**\n\n-   By analyzing the **geographic distribution** of drug use cases across provinces, one can identify patterns that may suggest localized factors contributing to drug abuse. This may include proximity to trafficking routes, socio-economic disparities, or regional differences in enforcement or education.\n\n-   Analysts should be prepared to look at this distribution in relation to **population density**, economic activity, access to healthcare, and law enforcement effectiveness. Yearly data will also allow for the identification of **trends over time**, such as regions where drug abuse is increasing or decreasing.\n\n### 6. **Policy and Enforcement**\n\n-   Thailand has a strong **anti-drug policy**, including harsh penalties for drug-related offenses. However, the effectiveness of these policies is debatable given the continued rise in drug use. An analyst should consider the impact of these policies, including whether they have driven drug abuse underground or led to unintended consequences, such as higher incarceration rates.\n\nIn analyzing this data, it is crucial to contextualize it within **regional geopolitics**, **infrastructure development**, **social factors**, and **government responses**. Mapping drug abuse cases by year and province can help to uncover hotspots, trends, and areas where intervention may be most needed. Understanding the **root causes** of drug abuse among vulnerable populations, particularly youths, is also essential in crafting effective policy recommendations and targeted interventions.\n\n# Installing and loading R packages\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npacman::p_load(sf, spdep, tmap, tidyverse,sfdep)\n```\n:::\n\n\n-   **sf**: This package is used for handling spatial data in R, allowing for operations on simple features (geometric objects).\n\n-   **spdep**: This package provides tools for spatial dependence, including functions for spatial weights and models.\n\n-   **tmap**: A package designed for thematic mapping, making it easy to create static and interactive maps.\n\n-   **tidyverse**: A collection of R packages designed for data science, including `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, and others that simplify data manipulation and visualization.\n\n-   **sfdep**: This package focuses on spatial dependency, providing tools for estimating spatial autocorrelation and conducting related analyses.\n\n# The data\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndrug_data <- read.csv(\"data/thai_drug_offenses_2017_2022.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nread a CSV (Comma-Separated Values) file containing data on drug offenses in Thailand from the years 2017 to 2022.

This indicates that the dataset covers a total of **6 years** of drug offense data.\n\n    -   The median year is **2020**, and the mean year is also **2020**, suggesting that the data is centered around this time period.\n\n-   **Types of Drug Offenses**:\n\n    -   The `types_of_drug_offenses` variable is categorical (character type) and contains a variety of different drug offenses.\n\n    -   The distribution of types may be analyzed further to determine which types of offenses are most common over the years.\n\n-   **Number of Cases (`no_cases`)**:\n\n    -   The `no_cases` variable indicates the number of drug offense cases recorded in the dataset.\n\n    -   **Minimum**: There are instances with **0 cases**, indicating that in some provinces or years, no drug offenses were reported.\n\n    -   **1st Quartile**: The first quartile (25th percentile) shows that **25% of the cases** had **1 or fewer** offenses, indicating low numbers of cases in a substantial portion of the dataset.\n\n    -   **Median**: The median of **70 cases** suggests that half of the entries reported **70 or fewer offenses**, highlighting a significant number of cases in the upper half.\n\n    -   **Mean**: The average number of cases is **535.3**, which is considerably higher than the median, suggesting that there are some provinces or years with exceptionally high numbers of cases that skew the average upwards.\n\n    -   **3rd Quartile**: The third quartile indicates that **75% of the cases** reported **623 or fewer offenses**, reflecting that a smaller portion of the dataset has a much larger number of offenses.\n\n    -   **Maximum**: The maximum number of cases reported is **17,131**, which indicates a significant outlier. This could represent a specific province or year with particularly high drug offenses that may require further investigation.\n\n-   **Province**:\n\n    -   The `province_en` variable, also categorical, lists the provinces in which the drug offenses occurred. The length of this variable being **7392** indicates that there are multiple entries for different provinces and years.\n\n    -   Analysis of this variable could reveal geographic patterns of drug offenses, helping identify regions that are more heavily impacted by drug issues.\n\nOnce the provincial boundaries are loaded into the `thailand_provinces` variable as a Simple Features (sf) object, it can be used for various analyse\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nthailand_provinces<- st_read(dsn=\"data/geospatial\",\n                         layer = \"tha_admbnda_adm1_rtsd_20220121\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nReading layer `tha_admbnda_adm1_rtsd_20220121' from data source \n  `C:\\edwing444\\IS415-GAA\\Take_Home_Ex\\Take_home_ex2\\data\\geospatial' \n  using driver `ESRI Shapefile'\nSimple feature collection with 77 features and 16 fields\nGeometry type: MULTIPOLYGON\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 97.34336 ymin: 5.613038 xmax: 105.637 ymax: 20.46507\nGeodetic CRS:  WGS 84\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Drop the ADM1_TH column\nthailand_provinces <- thailand_provinces %>%\n  select(-ADM1_TH,-ADM1_REF,-ADM1ALT1EN,-ADM1ALT2EN,-ADM1ALT1TH,-ADM1ALT2EN, -ADM1ALT2TH, -ADM0_TH) %>% \n  rename(province_en = ADM1_EN)\n\n# Drop the province_th column\ndrug_data <- drug_data %>%\n  select(-province_th)\n```\n:::\n\n\nI simplify the `thailand_provinces` dataset by removing columns that are not needed for further analysis, thus making the dataset cleaner and more manageable. Also, i rename the `ADM1_EN` column to `province_en`, which contains the province names in English. This provides a clearer and more intuitive column name for future analysis.\\\n\\\nNext, I remove the `province_th` column from the `drug_data` dataset, likely because it contains redundant or unnecessary information, especially if the `thailand_provinces` dataset now includes the relevant province information in English. Dropping this column helps streamline the `drug_data` dataset, focusing on the necessary columns that are crucial for the analysis of drug offenses.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nprovince_grouped <- drug_data %>%\n  group_by(fiscal_year, province_en)\n\n# Example: Summarize the total drug offenses for each group\nprovince_summary <- province_grouped %>%\n  summarise(total_offenses = sum(no_cases, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = \"keep\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nThis grouping allows for subsequent calculations to be performed within these groups, making it easier to analyze trends and patterns of drug offenses over time and across different provinces.\n\nThe result after summarising is a new data frame `province_summary` that contains three columns: `fiscal_year`, `province_en`, and `total_offenses`, which reflects the total number of offenses recorded for each province in each fiscal year.\n\nThe argument `.groups = \"keep\"` retains the grouping structure of the original data frame in the summarized output, which may be useful for further analysis or visualizations.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Join the drug abuse data with province polygons\ncombined_data <- thailand_provinces %>%\n  left_join(drug_data, by = \"province_en\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nNow I will merge the two datasets in a way that retains all the rows from the `thailand_provinces` dataset and includes matching rows from the `drug_data` dataset based on the `province_en` column.\n\n-   If a province in `thailand_provinces` does not have corresponding data in `drug_data`, the resulting `combined_data` will still include that province, but the columns from `drug_data` will contain `NA` (missing values).\n\nThe purpose of this operation is to create a combined dataset that integrates geographic information about the provinces with the corresponding drug offense data. This integration is used for mapping the data to **understand how the data looks like**\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Join the drug abuse province data with province polygons\ncombined_province_data <- thailand_provinces %>%\n  left_join(province_summary)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nJoining with `by = join_by(province_en)`\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe above merges the geographic data of provinces with the summarized drug offense data to create a comprehensive dataset that includes both spatial and analytical information.\n\n-   The join is done based on the common columns present in both datasets. Since `province_summary` is assumed to have the `province_en` column, it will merge the summarized drug offense totals for each province.\n\n-   If there are provinces in `thailand_provinces` that do not have corresponding entries in `province_summary`, they will still be included in the resulting dataset (`combined_province_data`), but the columns from `province_summary` will contain `NA` (missing values).\n\nThis integration is essential for **spatial analysis and for visualizing the data on maps**.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncombined_province_data <- combined_province_data %>%\n  filter(!is.na(total_offenses))\n```\n:::\n\n\nNow I clean the dataset by excluding any entries that do not have a valid total number of drug offenses.\n\nRemoving rows with `NA` values in the `total_offenses` column ensures that subsequent analyses or visualizations are based on complete data, leading to more accurate and reliable results.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r

This indicates that the simulated Moran's I values are more likely to be higher than the mean.\n\n2.  **Central Tendency:** The distribution appears to be centered around a value slightly greater than 0, suggesting that the majority of simulated values are close to 0.\n\n3.  **Spread:** The distribution is relatively wide, indicating that the simulated values are dispersed over a wider range.\n\n4.  **Observed Statistic:** The red vertical line represents the observed Moran's I statistic. It is located towards the right tail of the distribution, indicating that the observed value is relatively high compared to the simulated values.\n\n**Interpretation:**\n\n-   **Skewness:** The right-skewed distribution suggests that there are some simulated values that are significantly higher than the majority of the others. This could be due to the presence of strong spatial clusters or other factors influencing the distribution of Moran's I.\n\n-   **Central Tendency:** The fact that the majority of simulated values are close to 0 indicates that under random permutations, Moran's I tends to be close to 0, which is the expected value under no spatial autocorrelation.\n\n-   **Spread:** The relatively wide distribution suggests that the simulated values are not highly dispersed, which is expected given the nature of the Monte Carlo permutation test.\n\n-   **Observed Statistic:** The location of the observed Moran's I statistic in the right tail of the distribution indicates that it is significantly different from the simulated values. This suggests that the observed spatial autocorrelation is unlikely to occur by chance.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe histogram provides visual evidence for the statistical significance of the observed Moran's I statistic. The right-skewed distribution of simulated values suggests that the observed value is relatively high compared to the majority of the simulated values, supporting the conclusion of positive spatial autocorrelation.\n\n#### Mapping the local Moran’s I\n\nBefore mapping the local Moran’s I map, it is wise to append the local Moran’s I dataframe (i.e. localMI) onto hunan SpatialPolygonDataFrame. The code chunks below can be used to perform the task. The out SpatialPolygonDataFrame is called *hunan.localMI*.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nprovince.localMI <- cbind(combined_province_data,local_moran) %>%\n  rename(Pr.Ii = Pr.z....E.Ii..)\n```\n:::\n\n\nUsing choropleth mapping functions of **tmap** package, we can plot the local Moran’s I values by using the code chunks below.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntm_shape(province.localMI) +\n  tm_fill(col = \"Ii\", \n          style = \"pretty\",\n          palette = \"RdBu\",\n          title = \"local moran statistics\") +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nVariable(s) \"Ii\" contains positive and negative values, so midpoint is set to 0.

By carefully examining the hotspots and coldspots, researchers and policymakers can gain insights into the underlying factors driving these patterns and inform targeted interventions to address the drug problem..\n\n# Conclusion and Reflection\n\nThe spatial analysis of drug abuse indicators across Thailand reveals significant regional variations in drug offenses, highlighting the impact of Thailand's geographical proximity to the Golden Triangle, a notorious drug production area. Provinces near this region exhibit higher rates of drug-related offenses, underscoring their role as both consumption areas and transit hubs for drug trafficking. The use of spatial autocorrelation methods, such as global and local Moran's I, confirmed clusters of high drug offenses in these provinces. This suggests that drug-related activities are not randomly distributed but are spatially concentrated in specific areas.\n\nThe findings further emphasize the vulnerability of certain provinces, particularly those with strong transportation links and infrastructure developments, which facilitate the movement of drugs. The high concentration of drug offenses among youth, especially vocational school students, calls for targeted intervention programs aimed at this demographic.\n\n### Reflection\n\nThis assignment underscored the importance of using spatial analysis tools to understand the geographic distribution of social issues like drug abuse. By applying techniques such as spatial autocorrelation, we gained insights into the areas most affected by drug trafficking and consumption in Thailand. The data-driven approach helps inform policy decisions and resource allocation, allowing authorities to focus on high-risk regions and populations.\n\nThe exercise also illustrated the complexity of addressing drug abuse in Thailand, as it is influenced by a combination of geopolitical factors, infrastructural developments, and socio-economic conditions. Future studies could explore the relationship between drug offenses and other socio-economic variables, such as income levels, education, and employment, to further refine prevention strategies. Overall, spatial analysis provided a valuable lens through which to examine drug-related issues and supports the development of more effective, geographically targeted interventions.\n",
