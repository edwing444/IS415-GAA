    "text": "Thailand’s proximity to the Golden Triangle (the region where the borders of Thailand, Laos, and Myanmar meet) is significant as this area is historically known as a major hub for drug production and trafficking, particularly of opium and heroin. More recently, synthetic drugs like methamphetamine have become prevalent.\nThailand serves both as a transit route for drugs destined for third countries and as a significant market for illicit drugs. This geopolitical factor adds complexity to the issue, as it intersects with international drug trafficking networks and the nation’s domestic drug use.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the continuous development of transportation infrastructure in Thailand, the movement of drugs becomes easier both within the country and across borders. This infrastructure facilitates not only legitimate commerce but also illegal activities, particularly in regions that border drug-producing areas.\nAnalysts should consider transportation routes and connectivity between provinces, as these might correlate with higher rates of drug abuse or trafficking activity in certain regions.\n\n\n\n\n\nGlobally, drug use is on the rise, and Thailand reflects this trend. With 2.7 million youths reportedly using drugs, and 300,000 needing drug treatment, it’s clear that drug abuse is a pervasive social problem.\nA particular focus should be placed on youth involvement, especially among vocational-school students, as they show a higher incidence of drug abuse compared to secondary-school students. Analysts may want to explore why this demographic is more vulnerable and how their environment (e.g., educational settings, social circles) contributes to the problem.\n\n\n\n\n\nDrug abuse has severe health consequences, including addiction, overdose, and the spread of infectious diseases (e.g., HIV, hepatitis).\nThe financial cost includes both the economic burden on healthcare systems and the loss of productivity, particularly among the youth. Social consequences may include increased crime rates, family breakdowns, and reduced educational and employment opportunities for affected individuals.\nSocial services and the healthcare system in Thailand are likely under strain, with increasing demands for drug treatment and rehabilitation programs.\n\n\n\n\n\nBy analyzing the geographic distribution of drug use cases across provinces, one can identify patterns that may suggest localized factors contributing to drug abuse. This may include proximity to trafficking routes, socio-economic disparities, or regional differences in enforcement or education.\nAnalysts should be prepared to look at this distribution in relation to population density, economic activity, access to healthcare, and law enforcement effectiveness. Yearly data will also allow for the identification of trends over time, such as regions where drug abuse is increasing or decreasing.\n\n\n\n\n\nThailand has a strong anti-drug policy, including harsh penalties for drug-related offenses. However, the effectiveness of these policies is debatable given the continued rise in drug use. An analyst should consider the impact of these policies, including whether they have driven drug abuse underground or led to unintended consequences, such as higher incarceration rates.\n\nIn analyzing this data, it is crucial to contextualize it within regional geopolitics, infrastructure development, social factors, and government responses. Mapping drug abuse cases by year and province can help to uncover hotspots, trends, and areas where intervention may be most needed. Understanding the root causes of drug abuse among vulnerable populations, particularly youths, is also essential in crafting effective policy recommendations and targeted interventions."

It suggests a weak positive spatial autocorrelation. In other words, provinces with higher drug offense rates tend to be slightly more clustered together geographically than what would be expected under a random distribution.\nAlthough the autocorrelation is positive, it’s relatively weak, implying that while some clustering is present, it is not a strong spatial dependency.\n\nZ-Score ($K$): 21.8\n\nThe Z-score of 21.8 provides a standardized measure of how far the observed Moran’s I value is from what would be expected under a null hypothesis of no spatial autocorrelation.\nA Z-score of 21.8 is extremely high, indicating that the observed spatial autocorrelation is highly statistically significant and is not likely to have occurred by random chance. This strongly supports the existence of spatial clustering in the data.\n\n\n\n\nConclusion:\nThe analysis reveals a statistically significant but weak positive spatial autocorrelation in the distribution of drug offenses across the provinces. While the clustering is not particularly strong, it is unlikely to be random and suggests that there are underlying spatial processes at work. These processes could include factors such as geographical proximity to drug trafficking routes, socioeconomic conditions, or differences in law enforcement practices across regions. Further analysis could focus on identifying these factors more clearly through local spatial analysis and geographically weighted regression."

Given that the p-value is far below common thresholds (e.g., 0.05 or 0.01), we can confidently reject the null hypothesis of no spatial autocorrelation. This means that the observed spatial distribution of drug offenses is not random.\n\nInterpretation of the Hypothesis Test:\n\nThe alternative hypothesis here is that there is positive spatial autocorrelation in the data. Since the Moran’s I value is positive (0.19) and the p-value is extremely low, there is strong evidence to support the conclusion that provinces with similar levels of drug offenses tend to be located near each other.\nIn other words, areas with high offense rates are more likely to be near other areas with high offense rates, and the same applies to areas with lower rates.\n\nMoran’s I Statistic: 0.1903562142\n\nThe Global Moran’s I of 0.19 suggests a weak positive spatial autocorrelation. This implies that there is some clustering of provinces with similar drug offense levels, but the strength of this clustering is not particularly strong.\nDespite the weak strength, the spatial pattern is statistically significant, meaning that it is unlikely to occur by chance.\n\nStandard Deviate: 16.077\n\nThis represents the standard deviation of the Moran’s I statistic under random permutations (randomly shuffling the data). A value of 16.077 is quite high, indicating that the observed Moran’s I is far from random and further supports the finding of significant spatial autocorrelation.\n\nSample Estimates:\n\nExpectation (-0.0022271715): This is the expected value of the Moran’s I statistic if there were no spatial autocorrelation. It is close to zero, as would be expected under the null hypothesis.\nVariance (0.0001434901): This is the variance of Moran’s I under random permutations. A small variance suggests a precise estimate of Moran’s I, further supporting the reliability of the result.\n\n\n\nConclusion:\nThe analysis of drug offenses in Thailand using Moran’s I reveals that drug offenses are spatially clustered. Provinces with similar drug offense rates tend to be geographically close to each other, even though the strength of the clustering is weak. The results are statistically significant, indicating that this spatial clustering is unlikely to be due to random chance.\nThis finding suggests that there may be underlying spatial processes influencing the distribution of drug offenses, such as proximity to drug trafficking routes, local socioeconomic conditions, or regional law enforcement efforts. Further analysis, such as local Moran’s I or spatial regression, could provide more insight into specific areas with higher clustering and the factors driving this spatial pattern."

Spatial Clustering:\n\nNorthern Thailand: Several hotspots (areas with higher-than-average drug abuse rates) and coldspots (areas with lower-than-average drug abuse rates) are observed. These clusters suggest significant spatial autocorrelation, where provinces with high or low drug abuse rates are located near provinces with similar values.\nSouthern Thailand: Similar patterns of clustering emerge, with both hotspots and coldspots present. The distribution indicates the presence of regions with high drug abuse rates concentrated near other regions with similar characteristics.\nCentral Thailand: The distribution appears more scattered. Clusters are less pronounced, indicating fewer areas where drug abuse rates are spatially concentrated.\n\n\n\n2. Hotspots and Coldspots:\n\nHotspots: These regions, indicated by darker shades, represent areas with higher drug abuse rates. These areas exhibit a tendency to cluster geographically with other provinces experiencing similarly high rates. Hotspots are often located near drug trafficking routes or regions with economic and social vulnerabilities.\nColdspots: These areas, indicated by lighter shades, represent lower drug abuse rates. Coldspots tend to cluster with other provinces with similarly low rates, which may reflect better law enforcement, socioeconomic stability, or geographical isolation from major trafficking routes.\n\n\n\n\nPotential Explanations and Further Analysis:\n\n1. Geographical Factors:\n\nNorthern Thailand’s proximity to Myanmar and Laos, both major drug production areas (particularly for methamphetamines), could be influencing the high rates of drug abuse. Cross-border trafficking likely contributes to the clustering of hotspots, as these areas may serve as key transit or distribution points.\nSouthern Thailand’s proximity to maritime routes may also influence trafficking patterns, contributing to its observed clustering of drug abuse cases.\n\n\n\n2. Socioeconomic Conditions:\n\nAreas with high poverty, unemployment, and limited access to education are more vulnerable to higher rates of drug abuse. These socioeconomic challenges can create environments where drug trade and use flourish, reinforcing spatial clustering in regions with economic difficulties.\n\n\n\n3. Governance and Law Enforcement:\n\nThe effectiveness of local law enforcement and anti-drug initiatives likely varies across regions. In provinces with stronger law enforcement presence or targeted anti-drug campaigns, drug abuse rates may be lower, leading to the formation of coldspots. Conversely, areas with weaker enforcement may see rising drug abuse, contributing to hotspots.\n\n\n\n4. Drug Production and Trafficking:\n\nDrug trafficking routes and local production play a significant role in shaping spatial patterns. Regions that lie along key drug trafficking corridors may exhibit clustering of drug abuse, as these areas serve as hubs for drug distribution and consumption. Understanding the types of drugs involved and the logistical routes used for trafficking could provide more context for the clustering observed in Northern and Southern Thailand.\n\n\n\n\nConclusion:\nThe spatial clustering of drug abuse cases in Thailand reflects complex geopolitical, socioeconomic, and law enforcement dynamics. Northern and Southern Thailand, in particular, exhibit significant clustering due to their proximity to trafficking routes, while Central Thailand shows a more dispersed pattern."

This suggests significant spatial autocorrelation in drug abuse patterns across the provinces.\n\nHotspots (High-High Clusters):\n\nProvinces shaded darker (values 4 to 5) are indicative of high drug abuse rates clustering with other provinces experiencing similarly high rates. These areas may represent key locations for drug trafficking routes, high consumption, or poor enforcement.\n\nColdspots (Low-Low Clusters):\n\nLighter shaded provinces (values 1 to 0) signify low drug abuse rates clustering with other regions of low rates. These provinces could reflect areas with effective law enforcement, strong social infrastructure, or limited access to drugs.\n\n\n\n\nMap 2: p-value of Local Moran’s I (p_ii)\n\nStatistical Significance:\n\nThe second map showcases provinces where the Local Moran’s I is statistically significant, meaning the spatial clustering observed is unlikely due to random chance. P-values below 0.05 (shaded regions) mark areas where we have confidence in the clustering observed in Map 1.\n\nSignificant Clusters:\n\nProvinces with p-values below 0.05 (and even lower thresholds of 0.01 and 0.001) are areas with statistically significant spatial clustering. These regions can be considered true hotspots or coldspots, where drug abuse rates are influenced by strong spatial relationships and not random occurrences.\n\n\n\n\n\nCombined Analysis:\nBy examining both maps, we gain deeper insights into spatial patterns of drug abuse:\n\nIdentifying Strong Hotspots/Coldspots:\n\nProvinces that show both high Local Moran’s I values (darker shades in Map 1) and low p-values (significance in Map 2) represent strong hotspots of drug abuse. These provinces are not only clustering geographically with high rates but are also statistically significant, meaning this clustering is robust.\nSimilarly, coldspots identified in both maps represent regions where low drug abuse rates are geographically clustered with statistical significance.\n\nPolicy Implications:\n\nHotspot provinces may require enhanced law enforcement, social interventions, and anti-drug campaigns, as they are areas with high and concentrated drug abuse.\nColdspot provinces may serve as models for effective governance, law enforcement, or social strategies that could be replicated in higher-risk areas.\n\n\n\n\nConclusion:\nThe combined use of Local Moran’s I and its corresponding p-values provides a powerful tool to understand the spatial dynamics of drug abuse in Thailand. Provinces with both high Local Moran’s I and statistically significant p-values represent critical areas for focused interventions, whether they be law enforcement or socioeconomic support measures. This dual analysis helps to prioritize regions where drug abuse is not only high but spatially concentrated and significant."

This means that provinces with higher drug offense rates tend to be geographically clustered together, but the clustering is more localized than in the case of Moran’s I. This finding highlights the existence of regional influences—such as drug trafficking routes, socioeconomic conditions, or enforcement practices—that affect neighboring provinces similarly.\nUnderstanding these spatial patterns can guide targeted interventions by focusing resources in clustered regions and exploring how neighboring areas influence each other in the context of drug offenses.\n\nhist(bperm_GC$res, freq=TRUE, breaks=20, xlab=\"Simulated Geary c\")\nabline(v=1, col=\"red\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Observations:\n\nDistribution:\n\nThe histogram of simulated Geary’s C values shows a roughly bell-shaped (normal) distribution, meaning that most of the simulated values are close to a central value, and fewer values appear at the extremes.\n\n\n\nCentral Tendency:\n\nThe distribution is centered around a value slightly greater than 1.0, which is the expected value of Geary’s C under the assumption of no spatial autocorrelation. This suggests that, under random spatial configurations, the majority of simulated values align with the null hypothesis (no autocorrelation).\n\n\n\nSpread:\n\nThe relatively narrow spread of the distribution indicates that the simulated Geary’s C values are not highly dispersed, which is expected in the Monte Carlo permutation process.

This strongly supports the conclusion that the observed spatial autocorrelation is unlikely to have occurred by chance.\n\n\n\nConclusion:\nThe histogram provides clear visual evidence of the statistical significance of the observed Geary’s C statistic.

This number indicates the robustness of the statistical assessment, as a higher number of simulations generally increases reliability.\n\nStatistic = 0.19036:\n\nThe observed Moran’s I statistic is 0.19036. This value suggests a weak positive spatial autocorrelation, indicating that provinces with higher drug offense rates tend to be clustered together.\n\nObserved Rank 1000:\n\nThis indicates that the observed Moran’s I statistic is the largest among all 1000 simulated values, suggesting a strong deviation from randomness in the observed data.\n\np-value = 0.001:\n\nThe p-value of 0.001 indicates that the observed Moran’s I statistic is highly unlikely to occur by chance if there were no spatial autocorrelation. This small p-value provides strong evidence for the existence of spatial clustering in the drug offense data.\n\nAlternative Hypothesis: Greater:\n\nThe alternative hypothesis states that the expected value of Moran’s I is greater than the observed statistic. This implies that the analysis is specifically testing for positive spatial autocorrelation in the data.\n\n\n\n\nConclusion:\nThe output indicates that the Monte Carlo permutation test has provided robust statistical evidence supporting the existence of positive spatial autocorrelation in the distribution of drug offenses across provinces. The observed Moran’s I statistic of 0.19036, combined with the p-value of 0.001, strongly suggests that provinces with higher drug offenses tend to cluster together, rather than being distributed randomly. This finding can inform further investigations into the factors contributing to this spatial pattern.\n\nmean(bperm$res[1:999])\n\n[1] -0.002503914\n\n\n\nhist(bperm$res, \n     freq=TRUE, \n     breaks=20, \n     xlab=\"Simulated Moran's I\")\nabline(v=0, \n       col=\"red\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Observations:\n\nDistribution:\n\nThe histogram displays a right-skewed distribution, indicating a longer tail on the right side. This suggests that the simulated Moran’s I values are more frequently higher than the mean.\n\nCentral Tendency:\n\nThe distribution appears to be centered around a value slightly greater than 0, implying that most simulated values cluster close to 0. This is consistent with the expectation of no spatial autocorrelation.\n\nSpread:\n\nThe distribution is relatively wide, suggesting that the simulated Moran’s I values are dispersed over a broader range. This indicates variability in the spatial autocorrelation across the simulations.\n\nObserved Statistic:\n\nThe red vertical line, representing the observed Moran’s I statistic, is located towards the right tail of the distribution. This indicates that the observed value is relatively high compared to the majority of the simulated values.\n\n\n\n\nInterpretation:\n\nSkewness:\n\nThe right-skewed distribution suggests that there are some simulated values significantly higher than the others. This could be attributed to the presence of strong spatial clusters or other influential factors affecting the distribution of Moran’s I.\n\nCentral Tendency:\n\nThe clustering of most simulated values around 0 indicates that under random permutations, the Moran’s I statistic tends to be near 0, which aligns with the null hypothesis of no spatial autocorrelation.\n\nSpread:\n\nThe relatively wide distribution suggests that while the values cluster around the center, they also exhibit variability. This is expected in a Monte Carlo permutation test, where randomness can produce a range of outcomes.\n\nObserved Statistic:\n\nThe position of the observed Moran’s I statistic in the right tail signifies that it is notably different from the simulated values, reinforcing the notion that the observed spatial autocorrelation is unlikely to result from random chance.\n\n\n\n\nConclusion:\nThe histogram visually substantiates the statistical significance of the observed Moran’s I statistic. The right-skewed distribution of simulated values indicates that the observed Moran’s I is comparatively high relative to the majority of simulated outcomes. This supports the conclusion of positive spatial autocorrelation in the dataset, suggesting that areas with higher drug offenses are clustered together rather than randomly distributed. This insight can guide further exploration into the underlying factors influencing these spatial patterns.\n\nMapping the local Moran’s I\nBefore mapping the local Moran’s I map, it is wise to append the local Moran’s I dataframe (i.e. localMI) onto hunan SpatialPolygonDataFrame. The code chunks below can be used to perform the task. The out SpatialPolygonDataFrame is called province.localMI.\n\nprovince.localMI &lt;- cbind(combined_province_data,local_moran) %&gt;%\n  rename(Pr.Ii = Pr.z....E.Ii..)\n\nUsing choropleth mapping functions of tmap package, we can plot the local Moran’s I values by using the code chunks below.\n\ntm_shape(province.localMI) +\n  tm_fill(col = \"Ii\", \n          style = \"pretty\",\n          palette = \"RdBu\",\n          title = \"local moran statistics\") +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)\n\nVariable(s) \"Ii\" contains positive and negative values, so midpoint is set to 0. Set midpoint = NA to show the full spectrum of the color palette.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Observations:\n\nSpatial Clustering:\n\nThe map effectively illustrates distinct clusters of provinces based on the Local Moran’s I statistic, suggesting significant spatial autocorrelation in the distribution of the variable, likely related to drug offenses.\n\nHotspots and Coldspots:\n\nHotspots: Provinces in the northern and southern regions are marked with darker shades, indicating that these areas have high values of the variable and are surrounded by other regions with similarly high values.\nColdspots: In contrast, certain provinces in the central and southern regions exhibit lighter shades, suggesting they have low values and are also surrounded by other low-value areas.\n\nMixed Clusters:\n\nThe presence of mixed clusters (e.g., low-high or high-low) indicates complex spatial relationships, highlighting areas where drug offenses may not follow simple patterns of high or low values.\n\n\n\n\nPotential Explanations and Further Analysis:\nGiven the context of drug offenses in Thailand, several factors may contribute to these observed patterns:\n\nGeographical Factors:\n\nThe proximity to borders with countries like Myanmar and Laos may significantly influence drug trafficking routes. This geographical positioning can lead to concentrated areas of drug activity, forming the identified hotspots.\n\nSocioeconomic Conditions:\n\nAreas with higher poverty rates, unemployment, and a lack of educational opportunities may correlate with increased rates of drug offenses. These socioeconomic challenges can foster environments conducive to drug-related activities.\n\nGovernance and Law Enforcement:\n\nVariations in the effectiveness of law enforcement and anti-drug initiatives across regions can impact how drug offenses are distributed spatially. Regions with stronger law enforcement may show lower rates of drug offenses, contributing to the coldspots.\n\nDrug Production and Trafficking:\n\nUnderstanding the specific types of drugs involved in the offenses and their production and trafficking routes can provide deeper insights into the observed spatial patterns. Certain drugs may be more prevalent in specific areas, influenced by local production capabilities and trafficking networks.\n\n\n\n\nConclusion:\nThe map serves as a valuable visual tool for understanding the spatial distribution of drug offenses in Thailand and the statistical significance of the identified clusters. By closely examining the hotspots and coldspots, researchers and policymakers can better understand the underlying factors that drive these patterns. This knowledge can inform targeted interventions to effectively address the drug problem, tailoring strategies to the specific needs and conditions of different regions."

The conflict primarily involves the Myanmar military (Tatmadaw) and various ethnic armed organizations (EAOs) representing different ethnic minorities\nKey Factors Contributing to the Conflict\n\nEthnic Tensions: Deep-rooted ethnic tensions and historical grievances have been a major driving force behind the conflict. Many ethnic minorities, such as the Rohingya, Karen, and Shan, have long sought greater autonomy or independence from the central government.  \nMilitary Dominance: The Tatmadaw has exercised significant control over Myanmar’s political and military affairs for decades. Its authoritarian rule and suppression of dissent have fueled resentment among many ethnic groups.  \nResource Competition: Disputes over natural resources, such as timber, jade, and gas, have also contributed to the conflict. Control of these resources can provide significant economic and political advantages.\nExternal Influences: Neighboring countries, such as China and Thailand, have sometimes been involved in the conflict, either directly or indirectly, through their support for different factions.\n\nRecent Developments\nThe conflict escalated significantly following the 2021 military coup, which ousted the democratically elected government led by Aung San Suu Kyi.\nThe coup sparked widespread protests and civil disobedience, leading to a crackdown by the military. This crackdown has resulted in numerous casualties and human rights abuses.  \nIn response to the coup, a number of armed resistance groups have emerged, including the People’s Defense Forces (PDFs), which are civilian-led militias fighting against the military. These groups have engaged in clashes with the Tatmadaw across the country."

    "text": "Understanding KDE\n\n1. Clustering:\n\nNorthern Myanmar: The KDE map reveals a significant concentration of armed conflict events in the northern region, specifically in Kachin and Shan states. This area has long been a conflict hotspot due to the presence of multiple ethnic armed organizations. These groups have longstanding grievances related to autonomy, resource control, and ethnic identity, contributing to sustained violence in the region.\nWestern Myanmar: Another major cluster of conflict events is visible in the western part of Myanmar, particularly along the Bangladesh border. This region has experienced ongoing violence, notably between the Myanmar government and the Rohingya Muslim minority. The conflict here is driven by issues of ethnic persecution, displacement, and military operations.\n\n\n\n2. Dispersal:\n\nCentral Myanmar: While the conflict intensity is lower in central Myanmar compared to the north and west, there is still a noticeable dispersal of armed incidents across the region. This suggests that while conflict is concentrated in specific regions, it is not entirely restricted to them, reflecting a broader, albeit less intense, spread of violence. This dispersed pattern could be linked to sporadic incidents driven by local disputes, military presence, or emerging conflicts in previously stable areas.\n\n\n\n3. Proximity to Borders:\n\nChina and India: The proximity of conflict clusters to Myanmar’s borders with China and India underscores the potential influence of these neighboring countries on the conflict dynamics. The northern clusters near China may be affected by cross-border trade, refugee flows, or the presence of ethnic groups with ties to both countries. Similarly, the western cluster along the border with India may reflect cross-border insurgency activities, refugee movements, or influence from armed groups operating in both Myanmar and neighboring territories. These areas may also serve as strategic points for armed groups benefiting from cross-border support or utilizing porous borders for logistical purposes.\n\n\n\n4. Geographic Features:\n\nMountains and Rivers: The spatial distribution of conflict events may also be shaped by Myanmar’s geography. Mountainous regions and river systems act as natural barriers that either restrict or facilitate movement. For instance, mountainous areas can serve as strategic hideouts for insurgent groups, while rivers might influence the movement of troops or refugees, shaping the spatial dynamics of the conflict. Geographic features like the Irrawaddy River could also play a key role in both military strategies and the logistical support of rebel factions.\n\n\n\nOverall Insights:\nThe KDE map provides critical insights into the spatial distribution of armed conflict events in Myanmar . It illustrates:\n\nConcentrated hotspots in the north and west, reflecting deeply entrenched conflicts driven by ethnic, political, and territorial factors.\nA dispersal of conflict incidents in central Myanmar, suggesting that while the region is less volatile than the borders, it remains susceptible to isolated violence.\nThe influence of neighboring countries like China and India on conflict dynamics, with border regions experiencing heightened intensity likely due to cross-border insurgency or support.\nThe potential impact of geographic features, such as mountains and rivers, on conflict patterns, shaping where and how violence spreads.\n\nThese findings can inform conflict analysis, humanitarian interventions, and policy planning by identifying both high-intensity conflict zones and areas vulnerable to future escalations. Additionally, understanding the role of geography and international borders in shaping conflict may guide cross-border cooperation and peacebuilding efforts."

    "section": "Understanding K-Test",
    "text": "Understanding K-Test\nRipley’s K function is a prominent statistical tool used to explore the spatial distribution of point patterns, providing insight into whether points (in this case, conflict events) are clustered, dispersed, or randomly distributed. Below is a detailed interpretation of the analysis based on Ripley’s K function for conflict events in Myanmar.\n\n1. Clustering Evidence:\nThe K_iso(r) curve consistently lies above the K_pois(r) curve, indicating significant clustering of conflict events at all spatial scales. This means that the conflict events are not randomly distributed, but rather exhibit concentrations in specific areas. The clustering suggests that conflict events are more likely to occur near one another, hinting at the influence of underlying geographic, political, or social factors that create these clusters.\n\n\n2. Scale-Dependent Clustering:\nThe increasing divergence between K_iso(r) and K_pois(r) as distance (r) increases highlights that the intensity of clustering becomes more pronounced at larger scales. At shorter distances, localized clusters may represent hotspots of conflict within a limited area. As the scale increases, the divergence indicates that these clusters are not isolated but may be part of broader regional conflict zones, indicating an extensive conflict network across the country.\n\n\n3. Non-Stationarity:\nThe continuous upward trend in both the K_iso(r) and K_pois(r) curves, without leveling off, suggests that the spatial process driving the conflict events is non-stationary. In other words, the distribution and intensity of conflicts vary significantly across different regions of Myanmar. This non-stationarity implies that conflict dynamics are influenced by regional factors, such as the presence of specific ethnic groups, political boundaries, or military operations, which change across space.\n\n\n4. Intensity of Clustering:\nThe steep slope of the K_iso(r) curve compared to the K_pois(r) curve reflects the high intensity of clustering. This suggests that certain areas experienced significantly higher concentrations of conflict events than others, indicating focal points of violence or strategic regions where conflicts have been concentrated. The intensity might also reflect areas with continuous, prolonged violence.\n\n\n5. Large-Scale Patterns:\nThe persistence of clustering at large distances, up to 225,000 units (likely meters), indicates that the conflict has a broad spatial footprint. This suggests that conflicts are not only localized but also spread across vast regions, potentially linking disparate conflict zones. The spatial reach of these patterns points to an interconnected conflict dynamic, where events in one region may influence or are connected to events in far-flung areas.\n\n\n6. Implications for Conflict Dynamics:\n\nStrategic or Ethnic Concentration: The clustering pattern suggests that conflict events are concentrated around certain strategic areas, possibly reflecting ethnic territories, resource-rich zones, or locations with political or military significance.\nConflict Diffusion: The increasing divergence at larger distances might indicate the spread of conflict from one region to neighboring regions over time, potentially as a result of insurgencies, military operations, or population movements.\nNon-Randomness: The non-random nature of the conflict distribution highlights underlying structural drivers, such as ethnic tensions, resource competition, or political grievances, which shape the spatial arrangement of conflict.\n\n\n\n7. Methodological Considerations:\nThe use of K_iso(r) in this analysis suggests that isotropy corrections were applied. Isotropy assumes that the spatial process behaves similarly in all directions. By accounting for directional biases in the data, the analysis provides a more robust and reliable understanding of the conflict’s spatial patterns. This is crucial in regions like Myanmar, where geographical features or political boundaries may introduce directional influences on conflict events.\n\n\nConclusion:\nThe Ripley’s K function analysis reveals that conflict events in Myanmar exhibit significant spatial clustering, with clustering becoming more intense at larger spatial scales. The non-stationarity of the process and the persistence of clustering over large areas suggest that conflict is highly concentrated around key locations and may spread regionally. These findings underscore the importance of geographically targeted strategies for conflict resolution, peacekeeping efforts, and policy interventions. By identifying conflict hotspots and understanding the scale-dependent nature of clustering, decision-makers can develop more effective approaches to conflict management and resource allocation in Myanmar.\nFurther integration of spatial analysis with temporal trends, conflict typologies, and socio-political variables will provide a more comprehensive understanding of Myanmar’s conflict dynamics, facilitating more informed and strategic decision-making in this complex environment."

    "text": "Understanding Quarterly KDE layers\nThe Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) maps provide valuable insights into the evolving spatial patterns of armed conflict events in Myanmar over various time periods. The analysis of these maps highlights both persistent and fluctuating trends, along with temporal and regional variations. Below is a detailed analysis of the spatial distribution of armed conflict events, organized by key observations and specific time periods.\n\nOverall Observations for 2021 Q3 - 2022 Q4\n\nPersistent Hotspots:\nSeveral regions in Myanmar exhibit consistently high densities of armed conflict events across the time periods analyzed. Notably, the northern regions, particularly Kachin and Shan states, remain hotspots for conflict, as do areas near the western border with Bangladesh. These areas have maintained significant conflict activity throughout the periods, indicating entrenched issues that persist over time.\n\n\nFluctuations in Conflict Intensity:\nAlthough these regions continue to experience conflict, the intensity and concentration of events within them vary across quarters. Some periods exhibit more concentrated clusters, while others show a more dispersed distribution, reflecting the changing dynamics of conflict on the ground.\n\n\n\nSpecific Time Periods (2021-2022)\n\n2021 Q3 and Q4:\nDuring the latter half of 2021, the maps reveal a high concentration of conflict events in the northern part of Myanmar, particularly in Kachin and Shan states. In addition, significant clusters are observed in the western region, near the Bangladesh border, reflecting localized tensions and conflict in these areas.\n\n\n2022 Q1 and Q2:\nIn the first half of 2022, there is a slight reduction in the overall intensity of conflict compared to 2021. However, the northern and western regions remain primary hotspots. The spatial distribution of conflict events appears to be more dispersed in certain areas, suggesting a shift in conflict dynamics or potential de-escalation in some regions while conflict persists in others.\n\n\n2022 Q3 and Q4:\nBy the second half of 2022, the maps indicate a resurgence of conflict, particularly in Kachin state, where a high density of events is observed. The western region near the Bangladesh border also continues to experience conflict, although fluctuations in intensity are evident.\n\n\n\nAdditional Geographic and Regional Observations:\n\nInfluence of Geographic Features:\nThe spatial patterns of conflict may be influenced by Myanmar’s geographic features, such as mountainous terrain and river systems. These natural barriers can impact the movement of armed groups and the distribution of conflict events, potentially contributing to the clustering of events in certain areas while others remain less affected.\n\n\nBorder Dynamics and Neighboring Countries:\nThe proximity of Myanmar to its neighbors, particularly China and India, may also influence conflict dynamics, especially in border regions. Cross-border activities, such as arms smuggling or external support to local armed groups, could shape the spatial distribution of events in regions like northern Myanmar.\n\n\n\nOverall Observations for 2023 Q1 - 2024 Q2\n\nOverall Density Trends:\nThe KDE maps for 2023 and 2024 highlight a shift in the overall distribution of conflict, with a noticeable concentration of events in central Myanmar and the southern regions.\n\n2024-Q2: The highest densities are observed in central and southern Myanmar, with a gradual decrease toward the northern and eastern borders.\n2023-Q4: Similar patterns are observed, with central and southern regions continuing to experience the highest densities.\n2023-Q2 and Q3: There is a more dispersed distribution of conflict events, although the central region still maintains higher densities compared to other parts of the country.\n\n\n\nTemporal Variations and Shifts in Density:\nA comparison across time periods reveals several notable trends:\n\n2023 Q1 to 2023 Q4: Conflict density appears to have increased in the central region between these two quarters, indicating an escalation of violence or conflict activity in this area.\n2023 Q2 to 2023 Q3: The density shifts slightly, with potential increases observed in the southern region and a corresponding decrease in central Myanmar, highlighting fluctuations in the concentration of conflict over time.\n2024 Q1 to 2024 Q2: A resurgence of conflict in the central region is evident, with an increase in density between these two quarters.\n\n\n\n\nKey Observations Across the Entire Study Period (2021 Q3 - 2024 Q2):\n\nPersistence of Regional Hotspots:\nDespite fluctuations in conflict intensity, certain regions—such as Kachin, Shan, and the western border near Bangladesh—remain consistent hotspots for conflict. This persistence suggests deep-rooted, unresolved issues driving ongoing violence in these areas.\n\n\nTemporal Fluctuations in Conflict Density:\nWhile the overall spatial distribution of armed conflict in Myanmar remains dynamic, the analysis shows that conflict intensity can wax and wane within the same regions over time. The maps from 2021 Q3 to 2024 Q2 reveal periods of relative de-escalation, followed by resurgences of violence, particularly in central and northern Myanmar.\n\n\nClustering and Dispersal Patterns:\nThe KDE maps demonstrate that armed conflict events tend to cluster in certain regions, notably the central and southern parts of the country in more recent periods (2023-2024). This clustering may indicate increased activity in these regions, while more dispersed patterns in earlier periods suggest fluctuating control or movement of conflict across wider areas.\n\n\nImpact of Geography and Neighboring Influence:\nGeographic features, such as mountains and rivers, likely play a role in shaping the conflict landscape by influencing the movement and concentration of armed groups. Additionally, the impact of cross-border dynamics, particularly with China, India, and Bangladesh, may also contribute to the spatial distribution of conflict, especially in northern and western regions"

    "text": "Understanding quarterly 2nd order Spatial Point Pattern\nThe K-function plots offer detailed insights into the spatial clustering of conflict events by examining how points (conflict events) are distributed within a given distance (r) from each other. The following analysis explores the results across four quarters and highlights key patterns, clustering trends, and statistical significance.\n\nK-Function Results by Quarter\n\nQ1 and Q2: The K-function curve consistently lies above the expected value for complete spatial randomness (CSR) across all distances, indicating a strong and persistent clustering pattern. At both small and large spatial scales, the clustering of conflict events remains significant, with little evidence of randomness in the spatial distribution.\nQ3 and Q4: A similar clustering pattern is observed at smaller distances, where the K-function curve remains above the expected value, confirming the concentration of conflict events in localized areas. However, at larger distances, the curve gradually approaches the expected value, suggesting a more random distribution as the spatial scale increases.\n\n\n\nK-Test Deviation Analysis\n\nQ1 and Q2: The K-test deviation plots, which measure the statistical significance of the observed clustering, show strong deviations from zero across all distances. These significant deviations reinforce the clustering pattern identified in the K-function plots, with consistent clustering across both small and large distances.\nQ3 and Q4: While the K-test deviation curves show significant clustering at smaller distances, the deviations become less pronounced at larger distances. This reflects a spatial pattern where clustering is more intense in localized areas but disperses slightly at broader scales.\n\n\n\nKey Findings\n\nClustering Patterns:\n\nAcross all four quarters, the K-function plots reveal a consistent pattern of spatial clustering. This is especially pronounced in Q1 and Q2, where the clustering remains strong across all distances. Q3 and Q4 show a more complex pattern, with clustering at smaller scales but a tendency toward randomness at larger distances.\n\n\n\nTemporal Variation:\n\nThough clustering is observed in all quarters, the intensity and extent of clustering vary slightly over time. The earlier quarters (Q1 and Q2) show stronger, more uniform clustering, while the later quarters (Q3 and Q4) display a more dispersed pattern as distance increases.\n\n\n\nStatistical Significance:\n\nThe K-test deviation plots consistently show significant deviations from zero, providing statistical confirmation of the clustering observed in the K-function plots. These deviations are particularly strong at smaller distances, indicating that conflict events are more likely to cluster locally rather than occur randomly across the study area.\n\n\n\n\nTemporal Trends and Scale of Clustering\n\nConsistency Over Time:\nThe overall structure of the conflict remains stable across the analyzed quarters, with persistent clustering observed in all periods. This suggests that the spatial distribution of conflict events has not undergone significant changes from 2021 to 2023, reflecting entrenched conflict dynamics that continue to drive the spatial concentration of violence.\n\n\nClustering at Multiple Scales:\nThe clustering observed in the K-function plots is evident at various spatial scales, extending up to 150,000 units (likely meters or kilometers). At larger scales, the increasing divergence between the observed and expected K-functions suggests that clustering becomes more pronounced over broader geographic regions. This highlights that conflict is not just localized but affects larger swathes of territory.\n\n\n\nSpatial Non-Stationarity and Conflict Intensity\n\nNon-Stationarity: The continuous upward trend of the K-functions across all distances indicates spatial non-stationarity in the conflict. This means that the intensity and distribution of conflict events vary across different regions of Myanmar, with no clear point where the conflict stabilizes spatially.\nConflict Intensity: The steepness of the observed K-function curves, particularly in the early quarters (Q1 and Q2), suggests a high intensity of clustering. This indicates that conflict events are concentrated in specific areas rather than being randomly or evenly distributed throughout the country.\n\n\n\nImplications for Conflict Analysis\n\nStable Conflict Hotspots:\nThe persistent clustering identified in the K-function and K-test deviation plots points to stable conflict hotspots over time. These regions of concentrated conflict are likely driven by long-standing factors, such as ethnic divisions, strategic resource locations, or political tensions, that continue to fuel violence.\n\n\nTargeting Intervention Efforts:\nThe identification of consistent spatial clustering can help policymakers, humanitarian organizations, and peacekeeping missions in Myanmar target their intervention efforts more effectively. By focusing on these stable hotspots, resources can be allocated to the areas that require the most attention, reducing conflict intensity and alleviating the humanitarian impact in these regions.\n\n\nSustained, Long-Term Approaches:\nThe consistent spatial structure of conflict over time suggests that short-term interventions may not be sufficient to address the root causes of violence. Instead, sustained, targeted efforts are necessary to address the deeply entrenched conflict dynamics that persist across Myanmar’s regions"

    "section": "Understanding quarterly spatio-temporal KDE layers",
    "text": "Understanding quarterly spatio-temporal KDE layers\n\nSpatial Patterns\n\nPeripheral Concentration: The conflict is predominantly concentrated in the peripheral regions of Myanmar, particularly along the borders. This is consistent with historical trends of conflict occurring in ethnic minority areas, such as the northern, eastern, and western parts of the country, where separatist or insurgent movements are more active.\nLow Intensity in Central Plains: The central plains, including the capital region (likely Naypyidaw), show consistently low conflict intensity throughout the 12-month period. This may reflect the central region’s relative stability due to stronger government control and less ethnic fragmentation compared to the border regions.\n\n\n\nTemporal Evolution\n\nMonths 1-11: The conflict patterns remain relatively stable, with minor fluctuations in intensity. These fluctuations are seen primarily in the northern, eastern, and western regions, where conflict tends to concentrate, but there are no significant shifts in the overall spatial distribution.\nMonth 12: A notable escalation occurs in the final month, with a significant increase in conflict intensity, especially in the northern and eastern border regions. This spike in conflict could suggest a surge in fighting, possibly tied to political, military, or ethnic tensions intensifying.\n\n\n\nHotspots\n\nNorthern Region (Likely Kachin State): Throughout the 12-month period, the northern region consistently exhibits high conflict intensity. Kachin State, home to various insurgent groups, has long been a hotspot for ethnic conflict and military operations.\nEastern Region (Possibly Shan State): The eastern border region, possibly Shan State, shows persistent conflict presence. This area has been affected by multiple armed groups, making it another key hotspot of protracted conflict.\nWestern Region (Potentially Rakhine State): The western region experiences moderate conflict intensity, fluctuating over time. Rakhine State has a history of both ethnic violence and military confrontations, although the intensity appears lower and more variable compared to Kachin and Shan states.\n\n\n\nChanges in Conflict Intensity\n\nColor Scale Interpretation: The KDE maps use a color gradient to represent conflict intensity, with darker blues indicating lower density and pinks/reds signifying higher density. These color changes highlight the concentration and spread of conflict zones across Myanmar.\nLocalized High-Intensity Zones: Most of the earlier months (1-11) display smaller areas of red/pink, representing localized high-intensity conflict zones. These zones are typically confined to border areas and insurgent hotspots.\nExpansion in Month 12: Month 12 shows a considerable expansion of high-intensity conflict zones, with more areas transitioning to pink/red. This expansion could indicate an escalation of conflict, broader mobilization of armed groups, or increased government military action in these regions.\n\n\n\nGeographical Influences\n\nEthnic Diversity and Conflict: The conflict pattern follows Myanmar’s ethnically diverse and politically volatile border regions. These areas are home to various ethnic minorities who have historically engaged in armed struggle for autonomy or independence. The persistence of conflict in these regions suggests that ethnic tensions and separatist movements are key drivers of the violence.\nGovernment Control in Central Region: The central region’s relative peace likely corresponds to stronger government control and the absence of insurgent movements. This region, with its concentration of administrative and military infrastructure, may enjoy a higher level of security and stability compared to the less-governed border areas.\n\n\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nStable Hotspots: The northern, eastern, and western regions, particularly Kachin, Shan, and Rakhine states, remain persistent conflict hotspots. These areas have been historically prone to insurgency, and their continued presence as conflict zones indicates long-standing and unresolved ethnic tensions.\nConflict Escalation: The spike in conflict intensity in month 12 suggests an escalation in violence, possibly triggered by shifting political dynamics, increased insurgent activity, or military offensives. This sudden expansion in high-intensity zones underscores the volatile nature of Myanmar’s conflict landscape.\nStrategic Stability in the Central Plains: The central region, likely benefiting from stronger governmental presence and infrastructure, remains largely unaffected by the conflict. This division between the periphery and the center reflects the uneven nature of state control and the concentration of conflict in ethnically diverse border areas.\n\n\n\nImplications for Conflict Resolution and Humanitarian Intervention\n\nFocus on Hotspots: Given the persistence of conflict in the northern, eastern, and western regions, any peace-building or conflict resolution efforts should prioritize these areas. Ethnic grievances and the demand for autonomy are likely key factors driving the conflict in these regions.\nMonitoring Escalation: The significant uptick in conflict intensity in month 12 suggests that monitoring trends in violence is critical for predicting and preventing further escalations. International actors and local stakeholders must remain vigilant to shifts in the conflict landscape.\nLong-Term Stability in the Center: The stability of the central region may serve as a model for extending government control and peace to the periphery, although this will require careful navigation of ethnic tensions and historical grievances."

    "section": "Understanding daily spatio-temporal KDE layers",
    "text": "Understanding daily spatio-temporal KDE layers\n\n1. Spatial Distribution:\nThe provided image displays a Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) heat map, overlaid onto the geographical outline of Myanmar. The KDE method is employed to estimate the spatial distribution of conflict-related events or similar phenomena. The density is represented by a color gradient, where warmer colors (yellow and red) signify regions of higher event density, and cooler colors (blue) indicate lower density areas. This visualization provides a clear representation of how the intensity of events is distributed across the country on a daily basis.\n\n\n2. Focal Point:\nA significant concentration of activity is observed in the central region, likely corresponding to a major urban center or strategic area. This hotspot suggests a high density of conflict-related events, indicating that the area could be a focal point for ongoing unrest, military operations, or political turmoil. The concentration of events in this central region could be linked to factors such as political significance, strategic value, or logistical advantages.\n\n\n3. Intensity Gradients:\nThe KDE map reveals a radial dispersion pattern, with the highest intensity centered around the aforementioned focal point and gradually diminishing as one moves toward the periphery. This gradient suggests a core-periphery structure to the conflict, where the central region serves as an epicenter, and its effects or related events propagate outward. The decreasing intensity towards the edges could be attributed to logistical constraints, geographical barriers, or diminishing influence as one moves away from the central hotspot.\n\n\n4. Regional Variations:\nBeyond the central hotspot, the map shows additional areas of heightened activity in the northern and southeastern regions. These smaller clusters suggest that conflict or event density is not confined to the central area but is also present in other strategic locations. The presence of these secondary hotspots may be linked to local factors, such as ethnic insurgencies, border tensions, or resource-based conflicts, commonly observed in these peripheral regions.\n\n\n5. Scale and Interpretation:\nThe legend accompanying the map indicates values ranging from approximately 5e-15 to 3.5e-14, which likely represent probability densities rather than absolute counts of events. In the context of KDE analysis, these values provide insight into the relative concentration of events, with higher values indicating regions with a higher likelihood of conflict occurrence. The small magnitude of these values reflects the probabilistic nature of the KDE technique, which smooths the data to provide a clearer understanding of event distribution across the geographic area.\n\n\nConclusion:\nThe daily spatio-temporal KDE map effectively highlights the spatial structure of conflict events in Myanmar. The central region, with its high density of events, emerges as a focal point, suggesting it is a key area of concern. The outward radiating pattern of intensity implies that the conflict has significant regional implications, with potential ripple effects into surrounding areas. Smaller clusters of activity in the northern and southeastern regions further underscore the geographically dispersed nature of the conflict. The KDE map thus provides valuable insights into the spatial dynamics of conflict, offering critical information for strategic planning, resource allocation, and conflict resolution efforts."

    "text": "Vietnam’s economic landscape has evolved rapidly, with various provinces experiencing differing levels of competitiveness and growth. The Provincial Competitive Index (PCI) serves as a critical tool for assessing the business environment across regions, highlighting disparities and opportunities for development. This project aims to analyze the socio-economic implications of the PCI in Vietnam, utilizing advanced spatial and statistical methods like Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA), Emerging Geographical Hotspots, predictive trends, and regression analysis.\nKey reasons for this project:\n\nTo investigate the relationship between PCI scores and socio-economic development across different provinces in Vietnam.\nTo explore the spatial dynamics of competitiveness, identifying regions that are emerging as economic hotspots and those that require intervention.\nTo analyze trends and predict future developments in provincial competitiveness, enabling informed policy-making and investment decisions.\n\n\n\n\nAs Vietnam continues to develop, several challenges have emerged regarding regional competitiveness:\n\nRegional Disparities: There is significant variability in PCI scores among provinces, leading to uneven economic growth and development. Provinces with lower scores may struggle to attract investment and talent, resulting in persistent economic disparities.\nEmerging Economic Hotspots: Identifying and understanding the factors that contribute to the rise of emerging hotspots is crucial for strategic planning and resource allocation.\nPredictive Trends: Current analyses often lack foresight regarding future competitive trends, hindering effective long-term planning for provinces.\nPolicy Implementation: There is a need to evaluate the effectiveness of policies aimed at improving competitiveness and their socio-economic impacts across different regions.\n\n\n\n\nExisting research has extensively documented Vietnam’s economic growth and the role of the PCI in shaping business environments. However, few studies have integrated spatial analysis methods to provide a comprehensive view of regional competitiveness and its socio-economic impacts.\nExamples of relevant related work:\n\nWorld Bank Reports on Vietnam’s Economic Development: These reports discuss competitiveness but often do not delve deeply into spatial analysis and regional disparities.\n\nhttps://www.worldbank.org/en/country/vietnam\nData for Vietnam Economy : https://www.gso.gov.vn/en/homepage/\n\nPCI Reports by Vietnam Chamber of Commerce and Industry (VCCI): While they provide valuable insights into competitiveness, there is limited exploration of the socio-economic implications of PCI scores.\n\nhttps://pcivietnam.vn/en/publications/pci-full-report\nData for PCI : https://pcivietnam.vn/en/pci-data\n\n\nThis project will fill these gaps by employing advanced spatial techniques and predictive analysis to assess the socio-economic impacts of the PCI.\n\n\n\nOur analysis will adopt a data-driven methodology, integrating socio-economic data from Vietnam’s national statistics with PCI scores and spatial datasets.\n\n\nKey Data: Provincial PCI scores, economic indicators, demographic data.\nAnalysis: We will utilize LISA to identify spatial clusters of high and low PCI scores, revealing patterns of competitiveness across Vietnam. This will help us understand which provinces are performing well and which are lagging behind.\nExpected Findings: Identification of spatial clusters indicating regional competitiveness, providing insights into areas that may require targeted support.\n\n\n\nKey Data: Recent PCI data, investment trends, economic growth rates.\nAnalysis: This phase will focus on identifying emerging hotspots using Geographical Hotspot Analysis. We will examine factors contributing to the growth of these regions, including infrastructure development and policy initiatives.\nExpected Findings: A clearer understanding of which provinces are becoming economic centers and the underlying factors driving this growth.\n\n\n\nKey Data: Historical PCI scores, economic indicators, demographic changes.\nAnalysis: We will conduct regression analysis to identify key predictors of PCI scores and forecast future trends. This will include examining socio-economic variables that influence competitiveness.\nExpected Findings: Insights into potential future changes in provincial competitiveness, aiding policymakers in proactive planning.\n\n\n\nKey Data: Employment statistics, income levels, education, and healthcare data.\nAnalysis: We will assess how variations in PCI scores correlate with socio-economic outcomes, such as employment rates, income levels, and access to services in different provinces.\nExpected Findings: A comprehensive understanding of how provincial competitiveness affects socio-economic conditions and disparities across Vietnam.\n\n\n\n\nPrototypes:\n\nPCI Spatial Clusters Map: Visualizations depicting spatial clusters of PCI scores, highlighting areas of high and low competitiveness.\nEmerging Hotspots Analysis: Charts and maps showcasing provinces that are emerging as economic hotspots, along with relevant growth metrics.\nPredictive Trend Graphs: Graphs illustrating predicted trends in PCI scores and associated socio-economic indicators over time.\nSocio-Economic Impact Visualizations: Infographics contrasting socio-economic conditions in provinces with high and low PCI scores, revealing disparities in living standards and access to services.\nLabor Market Analysis: A detailed examination of labor market conditions in relation to PCI scores, focusing on job opportunities and wage disparities.\n\nThis project aims to provide valuable insights into the socio-economic implications of the Provincial Competitive Index in Vietnam, supporting informed decision-making and targeted development initiatives."

This will be performed by using the left_join function of dplyr package. The shan_sf simple feature data.frame will be used as the base data object and the ict_derived data.frame will be used as the join table.\nThe code chunks below is used to perform the task. The unique identifier used to join both data objects is TS_PCODE.\n\nshan_sf &lt;- left_join(shan_sf, \n                     ict_derived, by=c(\"TS_PCODE\"=\"TS_PCODE\"))\n  \nwrite_rds(shan_sf, \"data/rds/shan_sf.rds\")\n\nThe message above shows that TS_CODE field is the common field used to perform the left-join.\nIt is important to note that there is no new output data been created. Instead, the data fields from ict_derived data frame are now updated into the data frame of shan_sf.\n\nshan_sf &lt;- read_rds(\"data/rds/shan_sf.rds\")\n\n\n\n\nTo have a quick look at the distribution of Radio penetration rate of Shan State at township level, a choropleth map will be prepared.\nThe code chunks below are used to prepare the choroplethby using the qtm() function of tmap package.\n\nqtm(shan_sf, \"RADIO_PR\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to reveal the distribution shown in the choropleth map above are bias to the underlying total number of households at the townships, we will create two choropleth maps, one for the total number of households (i.e. TT_HOUSEHOLDS.map) and one for the total number of household with Radio (RADIO.map) by using the code chunk below.\n\nTT_HOUSEHOLDS.map &lt;- tm_shape(shan_sf) + \n  tm_fill(col = \"TT_HOUSEHOLDS\",\n          n = 5,\n          style = \"jenks\", \n          title = \"Total households\") + \n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) \n\nRADIO.map &lt;- tm_shape(shan_sf) + \n  tm_fill(col = \"RADIO\",\n          n = 5,\n          style = \"jenks\",\n          title = \"Number Radio \") + \n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) \n\ntmap_arrange(TT_HOUSEHOLDS.map, RADIO.map,\n             asp=NA, ncol=2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the choropleth maps above clearly show that townships with relatively larger number ot households are also showing relatively higher number of radio ownership.\nNow let us plot the choropleth maps showing the dsitribution of total number of households and Radio penetration rate by using the code chunk below.\n\ntm_shape(shan_sf) +\n    tm_polygons(c(\"TT_HOUSEHOLDS\", \"RADIO_PR\"),\n                style=\"jenks\") +\n    tm_facets(sync = TRUE, ncol = 2) +\n  tm_legend(legend.position = c(\"right\", \"bottom\"))+\n  tm_layout(outer.margins=0, asp=0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan you identify the differences?\nANS: The patterns of distribution are different. The map showing the distribution of total number of households shows a relatively uniform distribution, with higher concentrations in the central and southern parts of the state. The map showing the distribution of radio penetration rate shows a more concentrated pattern, with higher rates in the central and northern parts of the state. Overall, the maps show that townships with relatively larger numbers of households do not necessarily have higher radio penetration rates\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore we perform cluster analysis, it is important for us to ensure that the cluster variables are not highly correlated.\nIn this section, you will learn how to use corrplot.mixed() function of corrplot package to visualise and analyse the correlation of the input variables.\n\ncluster_vars.cor = cor(ict_derived[,12:17])\ncorrplot.mixed(cluster_vars.cor,\n         lower = \"ellipse\", \n               upper = \"number\",\n               tl.pos = \"lt\",\n               diag = \"l\",\n               tl.col = \"black\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe correlation plot above shows that COMPUTER_PR and INTERNET_PR are highly correlated. This suggest that only one of them should be used in the cluster analysis instead of both.\n\n\n\nIn this section, you will learn how to perform hierarchical cluster analysis.

hierarchical clustering function. In this hands-on exercise, hclust() of R stats will be used.\nhclust() employed agglomeration method to compute the cluster. Eight clustering algorithms are supported, they are: ward.D, ward.D2, single, complete, average(UPGMA), mcquitty(WPGMA), median(WPGMC) and centroid(UPGMC).\nThe code chunk below performs hierarchical cluster analysis using ward.D method. The hierarchical clustering output is stored in an object of class hclust which describes the tree produced by the clustering process.\n\nhclust_ward &lt;- hclust(proxmat, method = 'ward.D')\n\n\n\n\nIn R, there are several packages provide hierarchical clustering function.

The hierarchical clustering output is stored in an object of class hclust which describes the tree produced by the clustering process.\n\nhclust_ward &lt;- hclust(proxmat, method = 'ward.D')\n\nWe can then plot the tree by using plot() of R Graphics as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nplot(hclust_ward, cex = 0.6)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the challenge in performing hierarchical clustering is to identify stronger clustering structures. The issue can be solved by using use agnes() function of cluster package. It functions like hclus(), however, with the agnes() function you can also get the agglomerative coefficient, which measures the amount of clustering structure found (values closer to 1 suggest strong clustering structure).\nThe code chunk below will be used to compute the agglomerative coefficients of all hierarchical clustering algorithms.\n\nm &lt;- c( \"average\", \"single\", \"complete\", \"ward\")\nnames(m) &lt;- c( \"average\", \"single\", \"complete\", \"ward\")\n\nac &lt;- function(x) {\n  agnes(shan_ict, method = x)$ac\n}\n\nmap_dbl(m, ac)\n\n  average    single  complete      ward \n0.8131144 0.6628705 0.8950702 0.9427730 \n\n\nWith reference to the output above, we can see that Ward’s method provides the strongest clustering structure among the four methods assessed. Hence, in the subsequent analysis, only Ward’s method will be used.\n\n\n\nAnother technical challenge face by data analyst in performing clustering analysis is to determine the optimal clusters to retain.\nThere are three commonly used methods to determine the optimal clusters, they are:\n\nElbow Method\nAverage Silhouette Method\nGap Statistic Method\n\n\n\nThe gap statistic compares the total within intra-cluster variation for different values of k with their expected values under null reference distribution of the data. The estimate of the optimal clusters will be value that maximize the gap statistic (i.e., that yields the largest gap statistic). This means that the clustering structure is far away from the random uniform distribution of points.\nTo compute the gap statistic, clusGap() of cluster package will be used.\n\nset.seed(12345)\ngap_stat &lt;- clusGap(shan_ict, \n                    FUN = hcut, \n                    nstart = 25, \n                    K.max = 10, \n                    B = 50)\n# Print the result\nprint(gap_stat, method = \"firstmax\")\n\nClustering Gap statistic [\"clusGap\"] from call:\nclusGap(x = shan_ict, FUNcluster = hcut, K.max = 10, B = 50, nstart = 25)\nB=50 simulated reference sets, k = 1..10; spaceH0=\"scaledPCA\"\n --&gt; Number of clusters (method 'firstmax'): 1\n          logW   E.logW       gap     SE.sim\n [1,] 8.407129 8.680794 0.2736651 0.04460994\n [2,] 8.130029 8.350712 0.2206824 0.03880130\n [3,] 7.992265 8.202550 0.2102844 0.03362652\n [4,] 7.862224 8.080655 0.2184311 0.03784781\n [5,] 7.756461 7.978022 0.2215615 0.03897071\n [6,] 7.665594 7.887777 0.2221833 0.03973087\n [7,] 7.590919 7.806333 0.2154145 0.04054939\n [8,] 7.526680 7.731619 0.2049390 0.04198644\n [9,] 7.458024 7.660795 0.2027705 0.04421874\n[10,] 7.377412 7.593858 0.2164465 0.04540947\n\n\nAlso note that the hcut function used is from factoextra package.\nNext, we can visualise the plot by using fviz_gap_stat() of factoextra package.\n\nfviz_gap_stat(gap_stat)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith reference to the gap statistic graph above, the recommended number of cluster to retain is 1. However, it is not logical to retain only one cluster. By examine the gap statistic graph, the 6-cluster gives the largest gap statistic and should be the next best cluster to pick.\nNote: In addition to these commonly used approaches, the NbClust package, published by Charrad et al., 2014, provides 30 indices for determining the relevant number of clusters and proposes to users the best clustering scheme from the different results obtained by varying all combinations of number of clusters, distance measures, and clustering methods.\n\n\n\n\nIn the dendrogram displayed above, each leaf corresponds to one observation. As we move up the tree, observations that are similar to each other are combined into branches, which are themselves fused at a higher height.\nThe height of the fusion, provided on the vertical axis, indicates the (dis)similarity between two observations. The higher the height of the fusion, the less similar the observations are. Note that, conclusions about the proximity of two observations can be drawn only based on the height where branches containing those two observations first are fused. We cannot use the proximity of two observations along the horizontal axis as a criteria of their similarity.\nIt’s also possible to draw the dendrogram with a border around the selected clusters by using rect.hclust() of R stats. The argument border is used to specify the border colors for the rectangles.\n\nplot(hclust_ward, cex = 0.6)\nrect.hclust(hclust_ward, \n            k = 6, \n            border = 2:5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, we will learn how to perform visually-driven hiearchical clustering analysis by using heatmaply package.\nWith heatmaply, we are able to build both highly interactive cluster heatmap or static cluster heatmap.\n\n\nThe data was loaded into a data frame, but it has to be a data matrix to make your heatmap.\nThe code chunk below will be used to transform shan_ict data frame into a data matrix.\n\nshan_ict_mat &lt;- data.matrix(shan_ict)\n\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, the heatmaply() of heatmaply package is used to build an interactive cluster heatmap.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(shan_ict_mat),\n          Colv=NA,\n          dist_method = \"euclidean\",\n          hclust_method = \"ward.D\",\n          seriate = \"OLO\",\n          colors = Blues,\n          k_row = 6,\n          margins = c(NA,200,60,NA),\n          fontsize_row = 4,\n          fontsize_col = 5,\n          main=\"Geographic Segmentation of Shan State by ICT indicators\",\n          xlab = \"ICT Indicators\",\n          ylab = \"Townships of Shan State\"\n          )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith closed examination of the dendragram above, we have decided to retain six clusters.\ncutree() of R Base will be used in the code chunk below to derive a 6-cluster model.\n\ngroups &lt;- as.factor(cutree(hclust_ward, k=6))\n\nThe output is called groups. It is a list object.\nIn order to visualise the clusters, the groups object need to be appended onto shan_sf simple feature object.\nThe code chunk below form the join in three steps:\n\nthe groups list object will be converted into a matrix;\ncbind() is used to append groups matrix onto shan_sf to produce an output simple feature object called shan_sf_cluster; and\nrename of dplyr package is used to rename as.matrix.groups field as CLUSTER.\n\n\nshan_sf_cluster &lt;- cbind(shan_sf, as.matrix(groups)) %&gt;%\n  rename(`CLUSTER`=`as.matrix.groups.`)\n\nNext, qtm() of tmap package is used to plot the choropleth map showing the cluster formed.\n\nqtm(shan_sf_cluster, \"CLUSTER\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe choropleth map above reveals the clusters are very fragmented. The is one of the major limitation when non-spatial clustering algorithm such as hierarchical cluster analysis method is used."

They consist of two main parts. First, we will create the individual histograms using the code chunk below.\n\nradio &lt;- ggplot(data=ict_derived, \n             aes(x= `RADIO_PR`)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, \n                 color=\"black\", \n                 fill=\"light blue\")\n\ntv &lt;- ggplot(data=ict_derived, \n             aes(x= `TV_PR`)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, \n                 color=\"black\", \n                 fill=\"light blue\")\n\nllphone &lt;- ggplot(data=ict_derived, \n             aes(x= `LLPHONE_PR`)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, \n                 color=\"black\", \n                 fill=\"light blue\")\n\nmphone &lt;- ggplot(data=ict_derived, \n             aes(x= `MPHONE_PR`)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, \n                 color=\"black\", \n                 fill=\"light blue\")\n\ncomputer &lt;- ggplot(data=ict_derived, \n             aes(x= `COMPUTER_PR`)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, \n                 color=\"black\", \n                 fill=\"light blue\")\n\ninternet &lt;- ggplot(data=ict_derived, \n             aes(x= `INTERNET_PR`)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, \n                 color=\"black\", \n                 fill=\"light blue\")\n\nNext, the ggarrange() function of ggpubr package is used to group these histograms together.\n\nggarrange(radio, tv, llphone, mphone, computer, internet, \n          ncol = 3, \n          nrow = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the figure above, multiple histograms are plotted to reveal the distribution of the selected variables in the ict_derived data.frame.\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore we can prepare the choropleth map, we need to combine both the geospatial data object (i.e. shan_sf) and aspatial data.frame object (i.e. ict_derived) into one. This will be performed by using the left_join function of dplyr package. The shan_sf simple feature data.frame will be used as the base data object and the ict_derived data.frame will be used as the join table.\nThe code chunks below is used to perform the task. The unique identifier used to join both data objects is TS_PCODE.\n\nshan_sf &lt;- left_join(shan_sf, \n                     ict_derived, by=c(\"TS_PCODE\"=\"TS_PCODE\"))\n  \nwrite_rds(shan_sf, \"data/rds/shan_sf.rds\")\n\nThe message above shows that TS_CODE field is the common field used to perform the left-join.\nIt is important to note that there is no new output data been created. Instead, the data fields from ict_derived data frame are now updated into the data frame of shan_sf.\n\nshan_sf &lt;- read_rds(\"data/rds/shan_sf.rds\")\n\n\n\n\nTo have a quick look at the distribution of Radio penetration rate of Shan State at township level, a choropleth map will be prepared.\nThe code chunks below are used to prepare the choroplethby using the qtm() function of tmap package.\n\nqtm(shan_sf, \"RADIO_PR\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to reveal the distribution shown in the choropleth map above are bias to the underlying total number of households at the townships, we will create two choropleth maps, one for the total number of households (i.e. TT_HOUSEHOLDS.map) and one for the total number of household with Radio (RADIO.map) by using the code chunk below.\n\nTT_HOUSEHOLDS.map &lt;- tm_shape(shan_sf) + \n  tm_fill(col = \"TT_HOUSEHOLDS\",\n          n = 5,\n          style = \"jenks\", \n          title = \"Total households\") + \n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) \n\nRADIO.map &lt;- tm_shape(shan_sf) + \n  tm_fill(col = \"RADIO\",\n          n = 5,\n          style = \"jenks\",\n          title = \"Number Radio \") + \n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) \n\ntmap_arrange(TT_HOUSEHOLDS.map, RADIO.map,\n             asp=NA, ncol=2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the choropleth maps above clearly show that townships with relatively larger number ot households are also showing relatively higher number of radio ownership.\nNow let us plot the choropleth maps showing the dsitribution of total number of households and Radio penetration rate by using the code chunk below.\n\ntm_shape(shan_sf) +\n    tm_polygons(c(\"TT_HOUSEHOLDS\", \"RADIO_PR\"),\n                style=\"jenks\") +\n    tm_facets(sync = TRUE, ncol = 2) +\n  tm_legend(legend.position = c(\"right\", \"bottom\"))+\n  tm_layout(outer.margins=0, asp=0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan you identify the differences?\nANS: The patterns of distribution are different. The map showing the distribution of total number of households shows a relatively uniform distribution, with higher concentrations in the central and southern parts of the state. The map showing the distribution of radio penetration rate shows a more concentrated pattern, with higher rates in the central and northern parts of the state. Overall, the maps show that townships with relatively larger numbers of households do not necessarily have higher radio penetration rates"

hierarchical clustering function. In this hands-on exercise, hclust() of R stats will be used.\nhclust() employed agglomeration method to compute the cluster. Eight clustering algorithms are supported, they are: ward.D, ward.D2, single, complete, average(UPGMA), mcquitty(WPGMA), median(WPGMC) and centroid(UPGMC).\nThe code chunk below performs hierarchical cluster analysis using ward.D method. The hierarchical clustering output is stored in an object of class hclust which describes the tree produced by the clustering process.\n\nhclust_ward &lt;- hclust(proxmat, method = 'ward.D')\n\n\n\n\nIn R, there are several packages provide hierarchical clustering function.

The hierarchical clustering output is stored in an object of class hclust which describes the tree produced by the clustering process.\n\nhclust_ward &lt;- hclust(proxmat, method = 'ward.D')\n\nWe can then plot the tree by using plot() of R Graphics as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nplot(hclust_ward, cex = 0.6)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the challenge in performing hierarchical clustering is to identify stronger clustering structures. The issue can be solved by using use agnes() function of cluster package. It functions like hclus(), however, with the agnes() function you can also get the agglomerative coefficient, which measures the amount of clustering structure found (values closer to 1 suggest strong clustering structure).\nThe code chunk below will be used to compute the agglomerative coefficients of all hierarchical clustering algorithms.\n\nm &lt;- c( \"average\", \"single\", \"complete\", \"ward\")\nnames(m) &lt;- c( \"average\", \"single\", \"complete\", \"ward\")\n\nac &lt;- function(x) {\n  agnes(shan_ict, method = x)$ac\n}\n\nmap_dbl(m, ac)\n\n  average    single  complete      ward \n0.8131144 0.6628705 0.8950702 0.9427730 \n\n\nWith reference to the output above, we can see that Ward’s method provides the strongest clustering structure among the four methods assessed. Hence, in the subsequent analysis, only Ward’s method will be used.\n\n\n\nAnother technical challenge face by data analyst in performing clustering analysis is to determine the optimal clusters to retain.\nThere are three commonly used methods to determine the optimal clusters, they are:\n\nElbow Method\nAverage Silhouette Method\nGap Statistic Method\n\n\n\nThe gap statistic compares the total within intra-cluster variation for different values of k with their expected values under null reference distribution of the data. The estimate of the optimal clusters will be value that maximize the gap statistic (i.e., that yields the largest gap statistic). This means that the clustering structure is far away from the random uniform distribution of points.\nTo compute the gap statistic, clusGap() of cluster package will be used.\n\nset.seed(12345)\ngap_stat &lt;- clusGap(shan_ict, \n                    FUN = hcut, \n                    nstart = 25, \n                    K.max = 10, \n                    B = 50)\n# Print the result\nprint(gap_stat, method = \"firstmax\")\n\nClustering Gap statistic [\"clusGap\"] from call:\nclusGap(x = shan_ict, FUNcluster = hcut, K.max = 10, B = 50, nstart = 25)\nB=50 simulated reference sets, k = 1..10; spaceH0=\"scaledPCA\"\n --&gt; Number of clusters (method 'firstmax'): 1\n          logW   E.logW       gap     SE.sim\n [1,] 8.407129 8.680794 0.2736651 0.04460994\n [2,] 8.130029 8.350712 0.2206824 0.03880130\n [3,] 7.992265 8.202550 0.2102844 0.03362652\n [4,] 7.862224 8.080655 0.2184311 0.03784781\n [5,] 7.756461 7.978022 0.2215615 0.03897071\n [6,] 7.665594 7.887777 0.2221833 0.03973087\n [7,] 7.590919 7.806333 0.2154145 0.04054939\n [8,] 7.526680 7.731619 0.2049390 0.04198644\n [9,] 7.458024 7.660795 0.2027705 0.04421874\n[10,] 7.377412 7.593858 0.2164465 0.04540947\n\n\nAlso note that the hcut function used is from factoextra package.\nNext, we can visualise the plot by using fviz_gap_stat() of factoextra package.\n\nfviz_gap_stat(gap_stat)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith reference to the gap statistic graph above, the recommended number of cluster to retain is 1. However, it is not logical to retain only one cluster. By examine the gap statistic graph, the 6-cluster gives the largest gap statistic and should be the next best cluster to pick.\nNote: In addition to these commonly used approaches, the NbClust package, published by Charrad et al., 2014, provides 30 indices for determining the relevant number of clusters and proposes to users the best clustering scheme from the different results obtained by varying all combinations of number of clusters, distance measures, and clustering methods.\n\n\n\n\nIn the dendrogram displayed above, each leaf corresponds to one observation. As we move up the tree, observations that are similar to each other are combined into branches, which are themselves fused at a higher height.\nThe height of the fusion, provided on the vertical axis, indicates the (dis)similarity between two observations. The higher the height of the fusion, the less similar the observations are. Note that, conclusions about the proximity of two observations can be drawn only based on the height where branches containing those two observations first are fused. We cannot use the proximity of two observations along the horizontal axis as a criteria of their similarity.\nIt’s also possible to draw the dendrogram with a border around the selected clusters by using rect.hclust() of R stats. The argument border is used to specify the border colors for the rectangles.\n\nplot(hclust_ward, cex = 0.6)\nrect.hclust(hclust_ward, \n            k = 6, \n            border = 2:5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, we will learn how to perform visually-driven hiearchical clustering analysis by using heatmaply package.\nWith heatmaply, we are able to build both highly interactive cluster heatmap or static cluster heatmap.\n\n\nThe data was loaded into a data frame, but it has to be a data matrix to make your heatmap.\nThe code chunk below will be used to transform shan_ict data frame into a data matrix.\n\nshan_ict_mat &lt;- data.matrix(shan_ict)\n\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, the heatmaply() of heatmaply package is used to build an interactive cluster heatmap.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(shan_ict_mat),\n          Colv=NA,\n          dist_method = \"euclidean\",\n          hclust_method = \"ward.D\",\n          seriate = \"OLO\",\n          colors = Blues,\n          k_row = 6,\n          margins = c(NA,200,60,NA),\n          fontsize_row = 4,\n          fontsize_col = 5,\n          main=\"Geographic Segmentation of Shan State by ICT indicators\",\n          xlab = \"ICT Indicators\",\n          ylab = \"Townships of Shan State\"\n          )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith closed examination of the dendragram above, we have decided to retain six clusters.\ncutree() of R Base will be used in the code chunk below to derive a 6-cluster model.\n\ngroups &lt;- as.factor(cutree(hclust_ward, k=6))\n\nThe output is called groups. It is a list object.\nIn order to visualise the clusters, the groups object need to be appended onto shan_sf simple feature object.\nThe code chunk below form the join in three steps:\n\nthe groups list object will be converted into a matrix;\ncbind() is used to append groups matrix onto shan_sf to produce an output simple feature object called shan_sf_cluster; and\nrename of dplyr package is used to rename as.matrix.groups field as CLUSTER.\n\n\nshan_sf_cluster &lt;- cbind(shan_sf, as.matrix(groups)) %&gt;%\n  rename(`CLUSTER`=`as.matrix.groups.`)\n\nNext, qtm() of tmap package is used to plot the choropleth map showing the cluster formed.\n\nqtm(shan_sf_cluster, \"CLUSTER\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe choropleth map above reveals the clusters are very fragmented. The is one of the major limitation when non-spatial clustering algorithm such as hierarchical cluster analysis method is used."

There are two major analysis, namely:\n\nhierarchical cluster analysis; and\nspatially constrained cluster analysis.\n\n\n\nBy the end of this hands-on exercise, you will able:\n\nto convert GIS polygon data into R’s simple feature data.frame by using appropriate functions of sf package of R;\nto convert simple feature data.frame into R’s SpatialPolygonDataFrame object by using appropriate sf of package of R;\nto perform custer analysis by using hclust() of Base R;\nto perform spatially constrained cluster analysis using skater() of Base R; and\nto visualise the analysis output by using ggplot2 and tmap package.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn geobusiness and spatial policy, it is a common practice to delineate the market or planning area into homogeneous regions by using multivariate data. In this hands-on exercise, we are interested to delineate Shan State, Myanmar into homogeneous regions by using multiple Information and Communication technology (ICT) measures, namely: Radio, Television, Land line phone, Mobile phone, Computer, and Internet at home.\n\n\n\n\nTwo data sets will be used in this study. They are:\n\nMyanmar Township Boundary Data (i.e. myanmar_township_boundaries) : This is a GIS data in ESRI shapefile format. It consists of township boundary information of Myanmar. The spatial data are captured in polygon features.\nShan-ICT.csv: This is an extract of The 2014 Myanmar Population and Housing Census Myanmar at the township level.\n\nBoth data sets are download from Myanmar Information Management Unit (MIMU)\n\n\nBefore we get started, it is important for us to install the necessary R packages into R and launch these R packages into R environment.\nThe R packages needed for this exercise are as follows:\n\nSpatial data handling\n\nsf, rgdal and spdep\n\nAttribute data handling\n\ntidyverse, especially readr, ggplot2 and dplyr\n\nChoropleth mapping\n\ntmap\n\nMultivariate data visualisation and analysis\n\ncoorplot, ggpubr, and heatmaply\n\nCluster analysis\n\ncluster\nClustGeo\n\n\nThe code chunks below installs and launches these R packages into R environment.\n\npacman::p_load(spdep, tmap, sf, ClustGeo, \n               ggpubr, cluster, factoextra, NbClust,\n               heatmaply, corrplot, psych, tidyverse, GGally)\n\nNote: With tidyverse, we do not have to install readr, ggplot2 and dplyr packages separately. In fact, tidyverse also installs other very useful R packages such as tidyr.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, you will import Myanmar Township Boundary GIS data and its associated attrbiute table into R environment.\nThe Myanmar Township Boundary GIS data is in ESRI shapefile format.

This will be performed by using the left_join function of dplyr package. The shan_sf simple feature data.frame will be used as the base data object and the ict_derived data.frame will be used as the join table.\nThe code chunks below is used to perform the task. The unique identifier used to join both data objects is TS_PCODE.\n\nshan_sf &lt;- left_join(shan_sf, \n                     ict_derived, by=c(\"TS_PCODE\"=\"TS_PCODE\"))\n  \nwrite_rds(shan_sf, \"data/rds/shan_sf.rds\")\n\nThe message above shows that TS_CODE field is the common field used to perform the left-join.\nIt is important to note that there is no new output data been created. Instead, the data fields from ict_derived data frame are now updated into the data frame of shan_sf.\n\nshan_sf &lt;- read_rds(\"data/rds/shan_sf.rds\")\n\n\n\n\nTo have a quick look at the distribution of Radio penetration rate of Shan State at township level, a choropleth map will be prepared.\nThe code chunks below are used to prepare the choroplethby using the qtm() function of tmap package.\n\nqtm(shan_sf, \"RADIO_PR\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to reveal the distribution shown in the choropleth map above are bias to the underlying total number of households at the townships, we will create two choropleth maps, one for the total number of households (i.e. TT_HOUSEHOLDS.map) and one for the total number of household with Radio (RADIO.map) by using the code chunk below.\n\nTT_HOUSEHOLDS.map &lt;- tm_shape(shan_sf) + \n  tm_fill(col = \"TT_HOUSEHOLDS\",\n          n = 5,\n          style = \"jenks\", \n          title = \"Total households\") + \n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) \n\nRADIO.map &lt;- tm_shape(shan_sf) + \n  tm_fill(col = \"RADIO\",\n          n = 5,\n          style = \"jenks\",\n          title = \"Number Radio \") + \n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) \n\ntmap_arrange(TT_HOUSEHOLDS.map, RADIO.map,\n             asp=NA, ncol=2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the choropleth maps above clearly show that townships with relatively larger number ot households are also showing relatively higher number of radio ownership.\nNow let us plot the choropleth maps showing the dsitribution of total number of households and Radio penetration rate by using the code chunk below.\n\ntm_shape(shan_sf) +\n    tm_polygons(c(\"TT_HOUSEHOLDS\", \"RADIO_PR\"),\n                style=\"jenks\") +\n    tm_facets(sync = TRUE, ncol = 2) +\n  tm_legend(legend.position = c(\"right\", \"bottom\"))+\n  tm_layout(outer.margins=0, asp=0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan you identify the differences?\nANS: The patterns of distribution are different. The map showing the distribution of total number of households shows a relatively uniform distribution, with higher concentrations in the central and southern parts of the state. The map showing the distribution of radio penetration rate shows a more concentrated pattern, with higher rates in the central and northern parts of the state. Overall, the maps show that townships with relatively larger numbers of households do not necessarily have higher radio penetration rates\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore we perform cluster analysis, it is important for us to ensure that the cluster variables are not highly correlated.\nIn this section, you will learn how to use corrplot.mixed() function of corrplot package to visualise and analyse the correlation of the input variables.\n\ncluster_vars.cor = cor(ict_derived[,12:17])\ncorrplot.mixed(cluster_vars.cor,\n         lower = \"ellipse\", \n               upper = \"number\",\n               tl.pos = \"lt\",\n               diag = \"l\",\n               tl.col = \"black\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe correlation plot above shows that COMPUTER_PR and INTERNET_PR are highly correlated. This suggest that only one of them should be used in the cluster analysis instead of both.\n\n\n\nIn this section, you will learn how to perform hierarchical cluster analysis.

hierarchical clustering function. In this hands-on exercise, hclust() of R stats will be used.\nhclust() employed agglomeration method to compute the cluster. Eight clustering algorithms are supported, they are: ward.D, ward.D2, single, complete, average(UPGMA), mcquitty(WPGMA), median(WPGMC) and centroid(UPGMC).\nThe code chunk below performs hierarchical cluster analysis using ward.D method. The hierarchical clustering output is stored in an object of class hclust which describes the tree produced by the clustering process.\n\nhclust_ward &lt;- hclust(proxmat, method = 'ward.D')\n\n\n\n\nIn R, there are several packages provide hierarchical clustering function.

The hierarchical clustering output is stored in an object of class hclust which describes the tree produced by the clustering process.\n\nhclust_ward &lt;- hclust(proxmat, method = 'ward.D')\n\nWe can then plot the tree by using plot() of R Graphics as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nplot(hclust_ward, cex = 0.6)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the challenge in performing hierarchical clustering is to identify stronger clustering structures. The issue can be solved by using use agnes() function of cluster package. It functions like hclus(), however, with the agnes() function you can also get the agglomerative coefficient, which measures the amount of clustering structure found (values closer to 1 suggest strong clustering structure).\nThe code chunk below will be used to compute the agglomerative coefficients of all hierarchical clustering algorithms.\n\nm &lt;- c( \"average\", \"single\", \"complete\", \"ward\")\nnames(m) &lt;- c( \"average\", \"single\", \"complete\", \"ward\")\n\nac &lt;- function(x) {\n  agnes(shan_ict, method = x)$ac\n}\n\nmap_dbl(m, ac)\n\n  average    single  complete      ward \n0.8131144 0.6628705 0.8950702 0.9427730 \n\n\nWith reference to the output above, we can see that Ward’s method provides the strongest clustering structure among the four methods assessed. Hence, in the subsequent analysis, only Ward’s method will be used.\n\n\n\nAnother technical challenge face by data analyst in performing clustering analysis is to determine the optimal clusters to retain.\nThere are three commonly used methods to determine the optimal clusters, they are:\n\nElbow Method\nAverage Silhouette Method\nGap Statistic Method\n\n\n\nThe gap statistic compares the total within intra-cluster variation for different values of k with their expected values under null reference distribution of the data. The estimate of the optimal clusters will be value that maximize the gap statistic (i.e., that yields the largest gap statistic). This means that the clustering structure is far away from the random uniform distribution of points.\nTo compute the gap statistic, clusGap() of cluster package will be used.\n\nset.seed(12345)\ngap_stat &lt;- clusGap(shan_ict, \n                    FUN = hcut, \n                    nstart = 25, \n                    K.max = 10, \n                    B = 50)\n# Print the result\nprint(gap_stat, method = \"firstmax\")\n\nClustering Gap statistic [\"clusGap\"] from call:\nclusGap(x = shan_ict, FUNcluster = hcut, K.max = 10, B = 50, nstart = 25)\nB=50 simulated reference sets, k = 1..10; spaceH0=\"scaledPCA\"\n --&gt; Number of clusters (method 'firstmax'): 1\n          logW   E.logW       gap     SE.sim\n [1,] 8.407129 8.680794 0.2736651 0.04460994\n [2,] 8.130029 8.350712 0.2206824 0.03880130\n [3,] 7.992265 8.202550 0.2102844 0.03362652\n [4,] 7.862224 8.080655 0.2184311 0.03784781\n [5,] 7.756461 7.978022 0.2215615 0.03897071\n [6,] 7.665594 7.887777 0.2221833 0.03973087\n [7,] 7.590919 7.806333 0.2154145 0.04054939\n [8,] 7.526680 7.731619 0.2049390 0.04198644\n [9,] 7.458024 7.660795 0.2027705 0.04421874\n[10,] 7.377412 7.593858 0.2164465 0.04540947\n\n\nAlso note that the hcut function used is from factoextra package.\nNext, we can visualise the plot by using fviz_gap_stat() of factoextra package.\n\nfviz_gap_stat(gap_stat)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith reference to the gap statistic graph above, the recommended number of cluster to retain is 1. However, it is not logical to retain only one cluster. By examine the gap statistic graph, the 6-cluster gives the largest gap statistic and should be the next best cluster to pick.\nNote: In addition to these commonly used approaches, the NbClust package, published by Charrad et al., 2014, provides 30 indices for determining the relevant number of clusters and proposes to users the best clustering scheme from the different results obtained by varying all combinations of number of clusters, distance measures, and clustering methods.\n\n\n\n\nIn the dendrogram displayed above, each leaf corresponds to one observation. As we move up the tree, observations that are similar to each other are combined into branches, which are themselves fused at a higher height.\nThe height of the fusion, provided on the vertical axis, indicates the (dis)similarity between two observations. The higher the height of the fusion, the less similar the observations are. Note that, conclusions about the proximity of two observations can be drawn only based on the height where branches containing those two observations first are fused. We cannot use the proximity of two observations along the horizontal axis as a criteria of their similarity.\nIt’s also possible to draw the dendrogram with a border around the selected clusters by using rect.hclust() of R stats. The argument border is used to specify the border colors for the rectangles.\n\nplot(hclust_ward, cex = 0.6)\nrect.hclust(hclust_ward, \n            k = 6, \n            border = 2:5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, we will learn how to perform visually-driven hiearchical clustering analysis by using heatmaply package.\nWith heatmaply, we are able to build both highly interactive cluster heatmap or static cluster heatmap.\n\n\nThe data was loaded into a data frame, but it has to be a data matrix to make your heatmap.\nThe code chunk below will be used to transform shan_ict data frame into a data matrix.\n\nshan_ict_mat &lt;- data.matrix(shan_ict)\n\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, the heatmaply() of heatmaply package is used to build an interactive cluster heatmap.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(shan_ict_mat),\n          Colv=NA,\n          dist_method = \"euclidean\",\n          hclust_method = \"ward.D\",\n          seriate = \"OLO\",\n          colors = Blues,\n          k_row = 6,\n          margins = c(NA,200,60,NA),\n          fontsize_row = 4,\n          fontsize_col = 5,\n          main=\"Geographic Segmentation of Shan State by ICT indicators\",\n          xlab = \"ICT Indicators\",\n          ylab = \"Townships of Shan State\"\n          )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith closed examination of the dendragram above, we have decided to retain six clusters.\ncutree() of R Base will be used in the code chunk below to derive a 6-cluster model.\n\ngroups &lt;- as.factor(cutree(hclust_ward, k=6))\n\nThe output is called groups. It is a list object.\nIn order to visualise the clusters, the groups object need to be appended onto shan_sf simple feature object.\nThe code chunk below form the join in three steps:\n\nthe groups list object will be converted into a matrix;\ncbind() is used to append groups matrix onto shan_sf to produce an output simple feature object called shan_sf_cluster; and\nrename of dplyr package is used to rename as.matrix.groups field as CLUSTER.\n\n\nshan_sf_cluster &lt;- cbind(shan_sf, as.matrix(groups)) %&gt;%\n  rename(`CLUSTER`=`as.matrix.groups.`)\n\nNext, qtm() of tmap package is used to plot the choropleth map showing the cluster formed.\n\nqtm(shan_sf_cluster, \"CLUSTER\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe choropleth map above reveals the clusters are very fragmented. The is one of the major limitation when non-spatial clustering algorithm such as hierarchical cluster analysis method is used."

    "text": "12.8 Spatially Constrained Clustering: SKATER approach\nIn this section, you will learn how to derive spatially constrained cluster by using skater() method of spdep package.\n\n12.8.1 Converting into SpatialPolygonsDataFrame\nFirst, we need to convert shan_sf into SpatialPolygonsDataFrame. This is because SKATER function only support sp objects such as SpatialPolygonDataFrame.\nThe code chunk below uses as_Spatial() of sf package to convert shan_sf into a SpatialPolygonDataFrame called shan_sp.\n\nshan_sf &lt;- read_rds(\"data/rds/shan_sf.rds\")\nshan_sp &lt;- as_Spatial(shan_sf)\n\n\n\n12.8.2 Computing Neighbour List\nNext, poly2nd() of spdep package will be used to compute the neighbours list from polygon list.\n\nshan.nb &lt;- poly2nb(shan_sp)\nsummary(shan.nb)\n\nNeighbour list object:\nNumber of regions: 55 \nNumber of nonzero links: 264 \nPercentage nonzero weights: 8.727273 \nAverage number of links: 4.8 \nLink number distribution:\n\n 2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 \n 5  9  7 21  4  3  5  1 \n5 least connected regions:\n3 5 7 9 47 with 2 links\n1 most connected region:\n8 with 9 links\n\n\nWe can plot the neighbours list on shan_sp by using the code chunk below. Since we now can plot the community area boundaries as well, we plot this graph on top of the map. The first plot command gives the boundaries. This is followed by the plot of the neighbor list object, with coordinates applied to the original SpatialPolygonDataFrame (Shan state township boundaries) to extract the centroids of the polygons. These are used as the nodes for the graph representation. We also set the color to blue and specify add=TRUE to plot the network on top of the boundaries.\n\ncoords &lt;- st_coordinates(\n  st_centroid(st_geometry(shan_sf)))\n\n\nplot(st_geometry(shan_sf), \n     border=grey(.5))\nplot(shan.nb,\n     coords, \n     col=\"blue\", \n     add=TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that if you plot the network first and then the boundaries, some of the areas will be clipped. This is because the plotting area is determined by the characteristics of the first plot. In this example, because the boundary map extends further than the graph, we plot it first.\n\n\n12.8.3 Computing minimum spanning tree\n\n12.8.3.1 Calculating edge costs\nNext, nbcosts() of spdep package is used to compute the cost of each edge. It is the distance between it nodes. This function compute this distance using a data.frame with observations vector in each node.\nThe code chunk below is used to compute the cost of each edge.\n\nshan_ict &lt;- read_rds(\"data/rds/shan_ict.rds\")\nlcosts &lt;- nbcosts(shan.nb, shan_ict)\n\nFor each observation, this gives the pairwise dissimilarity between its values on the five variables and the values for the neighbouring observation (from the neighbour list). Basically, this is the notion of a generalised weight for a spatial weights matrix.\nNext, We will incorporate these costs into a weights object in the same way as we did in the calculation of inverse of distance weights. In other words, we convert the neighbour list to a list weights object by specifying the just computed lcosts as the weights.\nIn order to achieve this, nb2listw() of spdep package is used as shown in the code chunk below.\nNote that we specify the style as B to make sure the cost values are not row-standardised.\n\nshan.w &lt;- nb2listw(shan.nb, \n                   lcosts, \n                   style=\"B\")\nsummary(shan.w)\n\nCharacteristics of weights list object:\nNeighbour list object:\nNumber of regions: 55 \nNumber of nonzero links: 264 \nPercentage nonzero weights: 8.727273 \nAverage number of links: 4.8 \nLink number distribution:\n\n 2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 \n 5  9  7 21  4  3  5  1 \n5 least connected regions:\n3 5 7 9 47 with 2 links\n1 most connected region:\n8 with 9 links\n\nWeights style: B \nWeights constants summary:\n   n   nn       S0       S1        S2\nB 55 3025 76267.65 58260785 522016004\n\n\n\n\n\n12.8.4 Computing minimum spanning tree\nThe minimum spanning tree is computed by mean of the mstree() of spdep package as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nshan.mst &lt;- mstree(shan.w)\n\nAfter computing the MST, we can check its class and dimension by using the code chunk below.\n\nclass(shan.mst)\n\n[1] \"mst\"    \"matrix\"\n\n\n\ndim(shan.mst)\n\n[1] 54  3\n\n\nNote that the dimension is 54 and not 55. This is because the minimum spanning tree consists on n-1 edges (links) in order to traverse all the nodes.\nWe can display the content of shan.mst by using head() as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nhead(shan.mst)\n\n     [,1] [,2]      [,3]\n[1,]   51   30 108.37735\n[2,]   30   27  57.60801\n[3,]   27   41  78.29342\n[4,]   51   38 146.66661\n[5,]   41   39 162.80878\n[6,]   39   19  79.41836\n\n\nThe plot method for the MST include a way to show the observation numbers of the nodes in addition to the edge. As before, we plot this together with the township boundaries. We can see how the initial neighbour list is simplified to just one edge connecting each of the nodes, while passing through all the nodes.\n\nplot(st_geometry(shan_sf), \n                 border=gray(.5))\nplot.mst(shan.mst, \n         coords, \n         col=\"blue\", \n         cex.lab=0.7, \n         cex.circles=0.005, \n         add=TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12.8.5 Computing spatially constrained clusters using SKATER method\nThe code chunk below compute the spatially constrained cluster using skater() of spdep package.\n\nclust6 &lt;- spdep::skater(edges = shan.mst[,1:2], \n                 data = shan_ict, \n                 method = \"euclidean\", \n                 ncuts = 5)\n\nThe skater() takes three mandatory arguments: - the first two columns of the MST matrix (i.e. not the cost), - the data matrix (to update the costs as units are being grouped), and - the number of cuts. Note: It is set to one less than the number of clusters. So, the value specified is not the number of clusters, but the number of cuts in the graph, one less than the number of clusters.\nThe result of the skater() is an object of class skater. We can examine its contents by using the code chunk below.\n\nstr(clust6)\n\nList of 8\n $ groups      : num [1:55] 3 3 6 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 ...\n $ edges.groups:List of 6\n  ..$ :List of 3\n  .. ..$ node: num [1:18] 47 27 53 38 42 15 41 51 43 32 ...\n  .. ..$ edge: num [1:17, 1:3] 53 15 42 38 41 51 15 27 15 43 ...\n  .. ..$ ssw : num 3759\n  ..$ :List of 3\n  .. ..$ node: num [1:22] 13 48 54 55 45 37 34 16 25 52 ...\n  .. ..$ edge: num [1:21, 1:3] 48 55 54 37 34 16 45 25 13 13 ...\n  .. ..$ ssw : num 3423\n  ..$ :List of 3\n  .. ..$ node: num [1:11] 2 6 8 1 36 4 10 9 46 5 ...\n  .. ..$ edge: num [1:10, 1:3] 6 1 8 36 4 6 8 10 10 9 ...\n  .. ..$ ssw : num 1458\n  ..$ :List of 3\n  .. ..$ node: num [1:2] 44 20\n  .. ..$ edge: num [1, 1:3] 44 20 95\n  .. ..$ ssw : num 95\n  ..$ :List of 3\n  .. ..$ node: num 23\n  .. ..$ edge: num[0 , 1:3] \n  .. ..$ ssw : num 0\n  ..$ :List of 3\n  .. ..$ node: num 3\n  .. ..$ edge: num[0 , 1:3] \n  .. ..$ ssw : num 0\n $ not.prune   : NULL\n $ candidates  : int [1:6] 1 2 3 4 5 6\n $ ssto        : num 12613\n $ ssw         : num [1:6] 12613 10977 9962 9540 9123 ...\n $ crit        : num [1:2] 1 Inf\n $ vec.crit    : num [1:55] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...\n - attr(*, \"class\")= chr \"skater\"\n\n\nThe most interesting component of this list structure is the groups vector containing the labels of the cluster to which each observation belongs (as before, the label itself is arbitary). This is followed by a detailed summary for each of the clusters in the edges.groups list. Sum of squares measures are given as ssto for the total and ssw to show the effect of each of the cuts on the overall criterion.\nWe can check the cluster assignment by using the conde chunk below.\n\nccs6 &lt;- clust6$groups\nccs6\n\n [1] 3 3 6 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 1 2 2 2 1 2 2 2 1 4 2 1 5 2 2 2 1 2 1 1 2 1 1 2 2 3 2 1\n[39] 1 1 1 1 1 4 2 3 1 2 2 2 1 2 1 2 2\n\n\nWe can find out how many observations are in each cluster by means of the table command. Parenthetially, we can also find this as the dimension of each vector in the lists contained in edges.groups. For example, the first list has node with dimension 12, which is also the number of observations in the first cluster.\n\ntable(ccs6)\n\nccs6\n 1  2  3  4  5  6 \n18 22 11  2  1  1 \n\n\nLastly, we can also plot the pruned tree that shows the five clusters on top of the townshop area.\n\nplot(st_geometry(shan_sf), \n     border=gray(.5))\nplot(clust6, \n     coords, \n     cex.lab=.7,\n     groups.colors=c(\"red\",\"green\",\"blue\", \"brown\", \"pink\"),\n     cex.circles=0.005, \n     add=TRUE)\n\nWarning in segments(coords[id1, 1], coords[id1, 2], coords[id2, 1], coords[id2,\n: \"add\" is not a graphical parameter\nWarning in segments(coords[id1, 1], coords[id1, 2], coords[id2, 1], coords[id2,\n: \"add\" is not a graphical parameter\nWarning in segments(coords[id1, 1], coords[id1, 2], coords[id2, 1], coords[id2,\n: \"add\" is not a graphical parameter\nWarning in segments(coords[id1, 1], coords[id1, 2], coords[id2, 1], coords[id2,\n: \"add\" is not a graphical parameter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12.8.6 Visualising the clusters in choropleth map\nThe code chunk below is used to plot the newly derived clusters by using SKATER method.\n\nproxmat &lt;- dist(shan_ict, method = 'euclidean')\nhclust_ward &lt;- hclust(proxmat, method = 'ward.D')\ngroups &lt;- as.factor(cutree(hclust_ward, k=6))\n\n\nshan_sf_cluster &lt;- cbind(shan_sf, as.matrix(groups)) %&gt;%\n  rename(`CLUSTER`=`as.matrix.groups.`)\n\n\ngroups_mat &lt;- as.matrix(clust6$groups)\nshan_sf_spatialcluster &lt;- cbind(shan_sf_cluster, as.factor(groups_mat)) %&gt;%\n  rename(`SP_CLUSTER`=`as.factor.groups_mat.`)\nqtm(shan_sf_spatialcluster, \"SP_CLUSTER\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor easy comparison, it will be better to place both the hierarchical clustering and spatially constrained hierarchical clustering maps next to each other.\n\nhclust.map &lt;- qtm(shan_sf_cluster,\n                  \"CLUSTER\") + \n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) \n\nshclust.map &lt;- qtm(shan_sf_spatialcluster,\n                   \"SP_CLUSTER\") + \n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) \n\ntmap_arrange(hclust.map, shclust.map,\n             asp=NA, ncol=2)\n\nWarning: One tm layer group has duplicated layer types, which are omitted.

    "text": "12.9 Spatially Constrained Clustering: ClustGeo Method\nIn this section, you will gain hands-on experience on using functions provided by ClustGeo package to perform non-spatially constrained hierarchical cluster analysis and spatially constrained cluster analysis.\n\n12.9.1 A short note about ClustGeo package\nClustGeo package is an R package specially designed to support the need of performing spatially constrained cluster analysis. More specifically, it provides a Ward-like hierarchical clustering algorithm called hclustgeo() including spatial/geographical constraints.\nIn the nutshell, the algorithm uses two dissimilarity matrices D0 and D1 along with a mixing parameter alpha, whereby the value of alpha must be a real number between [0, 1]. D0 can be non-Euclidean and the weights of the observations can be non-uniform. It gives the dissimilarities in the attribute/clustering variable space. D1, on the other hand, gives the dissimilarities in the constraint space. The criterion minimised at each stage is a convex combination of the homogeneity criterion calculated with D0 and the homogeneity criterion calculated with D1.\nThe idea is then to determine a value of alpha which increases the spatial contiguity without deteriorating too much the quality of the solution based on the variables of interest. This need is supported by a function called choicealpha().\n\n\n12.9.2 Ward-like hierarchical clustering: ClustGeo\nClustGeo package provides function called hclustgeo() to perform a typical Ward-like hierarchical clustering just like hclust() you learned in previous section.\nTo perform non-spatially constrained hierarchical clustering, we only need to provide the function a dissimilarity matrix as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nnongeo_cluster &lt;- hclustgeo(proxmat)\nplot(nongeo_cluster, cex = 0.5)\nrect.hclust(nongeo_cluster, \n            k = 6, \n            border = 2:5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the dissimilarity matrix must be an object of class dist, i.e. an object obtained with the function dist().

Commonly, outputs or parameters of the GWmodel are mapped to provide a useful exploratory tool, which can often precede (and direct) a more traditional or sophisticated statistical analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe geospatial data used in this hands-on exercise is called MP14_SUBZONE_WEB_PL. It is in ESRI shapefile format. The shapefile consists of URA Master Plan 2014’s planning subzone boundaries. Polygon features are used to represent these geographic boundaries. The GIS data is in svy21 projected coordinates systems.\nThe code chunk below is used to import MP_SUBZONE_WEB_PL shapefile by using st_read() of sf packages.\n\nmpsz = st_read(dsn = \"data/geospatial\", layer = \"MP14_SUBZONE_WEB_PL\")\n\nThe report above shows that the R object used to contain the imported MP14_SUBZONE_WEB_PL shapefile is called mpsz and it is a simple feature object. The geometry type is multipolygon. it is also important to note that mpsz simple feature object does not have EPSG information.\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below updates the newly imported mpsz with the correct ESPG code (i.e. 3414)\n\nmpsz_svy21 &lt;- st_transform(mpsz, 3414)\n\nAfter transforming the projection metadata, you can varify the projection of the newly transformed mpsz_svy21 by using st_crs() of sf package.\nThe code chunk below will be used to varify the newly transformed mpsz_svy21.\n\nst_crs(mpsz_svy21)\n\nNotice that the EPSG: is indicated as 3414 now.\nNext, you will reveal the extent of mpsz_svy21 by using st_bbox() of sf package.\n\nst_bbox(mpsz_svy21) #view extent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe condo_resale_2015 is in csv file format. The codes chunk below uses read_csv() function of readr package to import condo_resale_2015 into R as a tibble data frame called condo_resale.\n\ncondo_resale = read_csv(\"data/aspatial/Condo_resale_2015.csv\")\n\nAfter importing the data file into R, it is important for us to examine if the data file has been imported correctly.\nThe codes chunks below uses glimpse() to display the data structure of will do the job.\n\nglimpse(condo_resale)\n\n\nhead(condo_resale$LONGITUDE) #see the data in XCOORD column\n\n\nhead(condo_resale$LATITUDE) #see the data in YCOORD column\n\nNext, summary() of base R is used to display the summary statistics of cond_resale tibble data frame.\n\nsummary(condo_resale)\n\n\n\n\nCurrently, the condo_resale tibble data frame is aspatial. We will convert it to a sf object. The code chunk below converts condo_resale data frame into a simple feature data frame by using st_as_sf() of sf packages.\n\ncondo_resale.sf &lt;- st_as_sf(condo_resale,\n                            coords = c(\"LONGITUDE\", \"LATITUDE\"),\n                            crs=4326) %&gt;%\n  st_transform(crs=3414)\n\nNotice that st_transform() of sf package is used to convert the coordinates from wgs84 (i.e. crs:4326) to svy21 (i.e. crs=3414).\nNext, head() is used to list the content of condo_resale.sf object.\n\nhead(condo_resale.sf)\n\nNotice that the output is in point feature data frame.\n\n\n\n\nIn the section, you will learn how to use statistical graphics functions of ggplot2 package to perform EDA.\n\n\nWe can plot the distribution of SELLING_PRICE by using appropriate Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nggplot(data=condo_resale.sf, aes(x=`SELLING_PRICE`)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\n\nThe figure above reveals a right skewed distribution. This means that more condominium units were transacted at relative lower prices.\nStatistically, the skewed dsitribution can be normalised by using log transformation. The code chunk below is used to derive a new variable called LOG_SELLING_PRICE by using a log transformation on the variable SELLING_PRICE. It is performed using mutate() of dplyr package.\n\ncondo_resale.sf &lt;- condo_resale.sf %&gt;%\n  mutate(`LOG_SELLING_PRICE` = log(SELLING_PRICE))\n\nNow, you can plot the LOG_SELLING_PRICE using the code chunk below.\n\nggplot(data=condo_resale.sf, aes(x=`LOG_SELLING_PRICE`)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\n\nNotice that the distribution is relatively less skewed after the transformation.\n\n\n\nIn this section, you will learn how to draw a small multiple histograms (also known as trellis plot) by using ggarrange() of ggpubr package.\nThe code chunk below is used to create 12 histograms. Then, ggarrange() is used to organised these histogram into a 3 columns by 4 rows small multiple plot.\n\nAREA_SQM &lt;- ggplot(data=condo_resale.sf, aes(x= `AREA_SQM`)) + \n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\n\nAGE &lt;- ggplot(data=condo_resale.sf, aes(x= `AGE`)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\n\nPROX_CBD &lt;- ggplot(data=condo_resale.sf, aes(x= `PROX_CBD`)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\n\nPROX_CHILDCARE &lt;- ggplot(data=condo_resale.sf, aes(x= `PROX_CHILDCARE`)) + \n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\n\nPROX_ELDERLYCARE &lt;- ggplot(data=condo_resale.sf, aes(x= `PROX_ELDERLYCARE`)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\n\nPROX_URA_GROWTH_AREA &lt;- ggplot(data=condo_resale.sf, \n                               aes(x= `PROX_URA_GROWTH_AREA`)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\n\nPROX_HAWKER_MARKET &lt;- ggplot(data=condo_resale.sf, aes(x= `PROX_HAWKER_MARKET`)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\n\nPROX_KINDERGARTEN &lt;- ggplot(data=condo_resale.sf, aes(x= `PROX_KINDERGARTEN`)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\n\nPROX_MRT &lt;- ggplot(data=condo_resale.sf, aes(x= `PROX_MRT`)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\n\nPROX_PARK &lt;- ggplot(data=condo_resale.sf, aes(x= `PROX_PARK`)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\n\nPROX_PRIMARY_SCH &lt;- ggplot(data=condo_resale.sf, aes(x= `PROX_PRIMARY_SCH`)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\n\nPROX_TOP_PRIMARY_SCH &lt;- ggplot(data=condo_resale.sf, \n                               aes(x= `PROX_TOP_PRIMARY_SCH`)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\n\nggarrange(AREA_SQM, AGE, PROX_CBD, PROX_CHILDCARE, PROX_ELDERLYCARE, \n          PROX_URA_GROWTH_AREA, PROX_HAWKER_MARKET, PROX_KINDERGARTEN, PROX_MRT,\n          PROX_PARK, PROX_PRIMARY_SCH, PROX_TOP_PRIMARY_SCH,  \n          ncol = 3, nrow = 4)\n\n\n\n\nLastly, we want to reveal the geospatial distribution condominium resale prices in Singapore. The map will be prepared by using tmap package.\nFirst, we will turn on the interactive mode of tmap by using the code chunk below.\n\ntmap_mode(\"view\")\n\nNext, the code chunks below is used to create an interactive point symbol map.\n\n# Set tmap option to check and fix invalid polygons\ntmap_options(check.and.fix = TRUE)\n\n# Your tmap plotting code\ntm_shape(mpsz_svy21) +\n  tm_polygons() +\ntm_shape(condo_resale.sf) +  \n  tm_dots(col = \"SELLING_PRICE\",\n          alpha = 0.6,\n          style = \"quantile\") +\n  tm_view(set.zoom.limits = c(11, 14))\n\nNotice that tm_dots() is used instead of tm_bubbles().\nset.zoom.limits argument of tm_view() sets the minimum and maximum zoom level to 11 and 14 respectively.\nBefore moving on to the next section, the code below will be used to turn R display into plot mode.\n\ntmap_mode(\"plot\")\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, you will learn how to building hedonic pricing models for condominium resale units using lm() of R base.\n\n\nFirst, we will build a simple linear regression model by using SELLING_PRICE as the dependent variable and AREA_SQM as the independent variable.\n\ncondo.slr &lt;- lm(formula=SELLING_PRICE ~ AREA_SQM, data = condo_resale.sf)\n\nlm() returns an object of class “lm” or for multiple responses of class c(“mlm”, “lm”).\nThe functions summary() and anova() can be used to obtain and print a summary and analysis of variance table of the results. The generic accessor functions coefficients, effects, fitted.values and residuals extract various useful features of the value returned by lm.\n\nsummary(condo.slr)\n\nThe output report reveals that the SELLING_PRICE can be explained by using the formula:\n      *y = -258121.1 + 14719x1*\nThe R-squared of 0.4518 reveals that the simple regression model built is able to explain about 45% of the resale prices.\nSince p-value is much smaller than 0.0001, we will reject the null hypothesis that mean is a good estimator of SELLING_PRICE. This will allow us to infer that simple linear regression model above is a good estimator of SELLING_PRICE.\nThe Coefficients: section of the report reveals that the p-values of both the estimates of the Intercept and ARA_SQM are smaller than 0.001. In view of this, the null hypothesis of the B0 and B1 are equal to 0 will be rejected. As a results, we will be able to infer that the B0 and B1 are good parameter estimates.\nTo visualise the best fit curve on a scatterplot, we can incorporate lm() as a method function in ggplot’s geometry as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nggplot(data=condo_resale.sf,  \n       aes(x=`AREA_SQM`, y=`SELLING_PRICE`)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = lm)\n\nFigure above reveals that there are a few statistical outliers with relatively high selling prices.\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore building a multiple regression model, it is important to ensure that the indepdent variables used are not highly correlated to each other. If these highly correlated independent variables are used in building a regression model by mistake, the quality of the model will be compromised. This phenomenon is known as multicollinearity in statistics.\nCorrelation matrix is commonly used to visualise the relationships between the independent variables. Beside the pairs() of R, there are many packages support the display of a correlation matrix. In this section, the corrplot package will be used.\nThe code chunk below is used to plot a scatterplot matrix of the relationship between the independent variables in condo_resale data.frame.\n\ncorrplot(cor(condo_resale[, 5:23]), diag = FALSE, order = \"AOE\",\n         tl.pos = \"td\", tl.cex = 0.5, method = \"number\", type = \"upper\")\n\nMatrix reorder is very important for mining the hiden structure and patter in the matrix. There are four methods in corrplot (parameter order), named “AOE”, “FPC”, “hclust”, “alphabet”. In the code chunk above, AOE order is used. It orders the variables by using the angular order of the eigenvectors method suggested by Michael Friendly.\nFrom the scatterplot matrix, it is clear that Freehold is highly correlated to LEASE_99YEAR. In view of this, it is wiser to only include either one of them in the subsequent model building. As a result, LEASE_99YEAR is excluded in the subsequent model building.\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below using lm() to calibrate the multiple linear regression model.\n\ncondo.mlr &lt;- lm(formula = SELLING_PRICE ~ AREA_SQM + AGE    + \n                  PROX_CBD + PROX_CHILDCARE + PROX_ELDERLYCARE +\n                  PROX_URA_GROWTH_AREA + PROX_HAWKER_MARKET + PROX_KINDERGARTEN + \n                  PROX_MRT  + PROX_PARK + PROX_PRIMARY_SCH + \n                  PROX_TOP_PRIMARY_SCH + PROX_SHOPPING_MALL + PROX_SUPERMARKET + \n                  PROX_BUS_STOP + NO_Of_UNITS + FAMILY_FRIENDLY + FREEHOLD, \n                data=condo_resale.sf)\nsummary(condo.mlr)\n\n\n\n\nWith reference to the report above, it is clear that not all the independent variables are statistically significant. We will revised the model by removing those variables which are not statistically significant.\nNow, we are ready to calibrate the revised model by using the code chunk below.\n\ncondo.mlr1 &lt;- lm(formula = SELLING_PRICE ~ AREA_SQM + AGE + \n                   PROX_CBD + PROX_CHILDCARE + PROX_ELDERLYCARE +\n                   PROX_URA_GROWTH_AREA + PROX_MRT  + PROX_PARK + \n                   PROX_PRIMARY_SCH + PROX_SHOPPING_MALL    + PROX_BUS_STOP + \n                   NO_Of_UNITS + FAMILY_FRIENDLY + FREEHOLD,\n                 data=condo_resale.sf)\nols_regress(condo.mlr1)\n\n\n\n\nThe gtsummary package provides an elegant and flexible way to create publication-ready summary tables in R.\nIn the code chunk below, tbl_regression() is used to create a well formatted regression report.\n\ntbl_regression(condo.mlr1, intercept = TRUE)1\n\nWith gtsummary package, model statistics can be included in the report by either appending them to the report table by using add_glance_table() or adding as a table source note by using add_glance_source_note() as shown in the code chunk below.\n\ntbl_regression(condo.mlr1, \n               intercept = TRUE) %&gt;% \n  add_glance_source_note(\n    label = list(sigma ~ \"\\U03C3\"),\n    include = c(r.squared, adj.r.squared, \n                AIC, statistic,\n                p.value, sigma))\n\nFor more customisation options, refer to Tutorial: tbl_regression\n\n\nIn this section, we would like to introduce you a fantastic R package specially programmed for performing OLS regression. It is called olsrr. It provides a collection of very useful methods for building better multiple linear regression models:\n\ncomprehensive regression output\nresidual diagnostics\nmeasures of influence\nheteroskedasticity tests\ncollinearity diagnostics\nmodel fit assessment\nvariable contribution assessment\nvariable selection procedures\n\nIn the code chunk below, the ols_vif_tol() of olsrr package is used to test if there are sign of multicollinearity.\n\nols_vif_tol(condo.mlr1)\n\nSince the VIF of the independent variables are less than 10. We can safely conclude that there are no sign of multicollinearity among the independent variables.\n\n\n\nIn multiple linear regression, it is important for us to test the assumption that linearity and additivity of the relationship between dependent and independent variables.\nIn the code chunk below, the ols_plot_resid_fit() of olsrr package is used to perform linearity assumption test.\n\nols_plot_resid_fit(condo.mlr1)\n\nThe figure above reveals that most of the data poitns are scattered around the 0 line, hence we can safely conclude that the relationships between the dependent variable and independent variables are linear.\n\n\n\nLastly, the code chunk below uses ols_plot_resid_hist() of olsrr package to perform normality assumption test.\n\nols_plot_resid_hist(condo.mlr1)\n\nThe figure reveals that the residual of the multiple linear regression model (i.e. condo.mlr1) is resemble normal distribution.\nIf you prefer formal statistical test methods, the ols_test_normality() of olsrr package can be used as shown in the code chun below.\n\nols_test_normality(condo.mlr1)\n\nThe summary table above reveals that the p-values of the four tests are way smaller than the alpha value of 0.05. Hence we will reject the null hypothesis and infer that there is statistical evidence that the residual are not normally distributed.\n\n\n\nThe hedonic model we try to build are using geographically referenced attributes, hence it is also important for us to visual the residual of the hedonic pricing model.\nIn order to perform spatial autocorrelation test, we need to convert condo_resale.sf from sf data frame into a SpatialPointsDataFrame.\nFirst, we will export the residual of the hedonic pricing model and save it as a data frame.\n\nmlr.output &lt;- as.data.frame(condo.mlr1$residuals)\n\nNext, we will join the newly created data frame with condo_resale.sf object.\n\ncondo_resale.res.sf &lt;- cbind(condo_resale.sf, \n                        condo.mlr1$residuals) %&gt;%\nrename(`MLR_RES` = `condo.mlr1.residuals`)\n\nNext, we will convert condo_resale.res.sf from simple feature object into a SpatialPointsDataFrame because spdep package can only process sp conformed spatial data objects.\nThe code chunk below will be used to perform the data conversion process.\n\ncondo_resale.sp &lt;- as_Spatial(condo_resale.res.sf)\ncondo_resale.sp\n\nNext, we will use tmap package to display the distribution of the residuals on an interactive map.\nThe code churn below will turn on the interactive mode of tmap.\n\ntmap_mode(\"view\")\n\nThe code chunks below is used to create an interactive point symbol map.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_svy21)+\n  tmap_options(check.and.fix = TRUE) +\n  tm_polygons(alpha = 0.4) +\ntm_shape(condo_resale.res.sf) +  \n  tm_dots(col = \"MLR_RES\",\n          alpha = 0.6,\n          style=\"quantile\") +\n  tm_view(set.zoom.limits = c(11,14))\n\nRemember to switch back to “plot” mode before continue.\n\ntmap_mode(\"plot\")\n\nThe figure above reveal that there is sign of spatial autocorrelation.\nTo proof that our observation is indeed true, the Moran’s I test will be performed\nFirst, we will compute the distance-based weight matrix by using dnearneigh() function of spdep.\n\nnb &lt;- dnearneigh(coordinates(condo_resale.sp), 0, 1500, longlat = FALSE)\nsummary(nb)\n\nNext, nb2listw() of spdep packge will be used to convert the output neighbours lists (i.e. nb) into a spatial weights.\n\nnb_lw &lt;- nb2listw(nb, style = 'W')\nsummary(nb_lw)\n\nNext, lm.morantest() of spdep package will be used to perform Moran’s I test for residual spatial autocorrelation\n\nlm.morantest(condo.mlr1, nb_lw)\n\nThe Global Moran’s I test for residual spatial autocorrelation shows that it’s p-value is less than 0.00000000000000022 which is less than the alpha value of 0.05. Hence, we will reject the null hypothesis that the residuals are randomly distributed.\nSince the Observed Global Moran I = 0.1424418 which is greater than 0, we can infer than the residuals resemble cluster distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, you are going to learn how to modelling hedonic pricing using both the fixed and adaptive bandwidth schemes\n\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below bw.gwr() of GWModel package is used to determine the optimal fixed bandwidth to use in the model. Notice that the argument adaptive is set to FALSE indicates that we are interested to compute the fixed bandwidth.\nThere are two possible approaches can be uused to determine the stopping rule, they are: CV cross-validation approach and AIC corrected (AICc) approach. We define the stopping rule using approach argeement.\n\nbw.fixed &lt;- bw.gwr(formula = SELLING_PRICE ~ AREA_SQM + AGE + PROX_CBD + \n                     PROX_CHILDCARE + PROX_ELDERLYCARE  + PROX_URA_GROWTH_AREA + \n                     PROX_MRT   + PROX_PARK + PROX_PRIMARY_SCH + \n                     PROX_SHOPPING_MALL + PROX_BUS_STOP + NO_Of_UNITS + \n                     FAMILY_FRIENDLY + FREEHOLD, \n                   data=condo_resale.sp, \n                   approach=\"CV\", \n                   kernel=\"gaussian\", \n                   adaptive=FALSE, \n                   longlat=FALSE)\n\nThe result shows that the recommended bandwidth is 971.3405 metres.\nQuiz: Do you know why it is in metre?\nThe bandwidth in this case is measured in meters because the longlat=FALSE argument was set in the spatial analysis function.\nBy default, many spatial libraries use geographic coordinates (longitude and latitude) when longlat=TRUE, meaning that distances are interpreted in angular units (degrees). However, when longlat=FALSE, the analysis assumes a projected coordinate system where distances are measured in linear units like meters or kilometers, which is common for accurate spatial distance measurements in GIS.\nIn other words, the analysis is performed in a projected coordinate system, such as UTM where the units are in meters. This is essential for accurate distance-based calculations, like kernel density estimation, which would be incorrect if the distances were interpreted in degrees.\nSo, the bandwidth is in meters because the spatial data has been projected into a system that uses meters as the unit of measurement.\n\n\n\nNow we can use the code chunk below to calibrate the gwr model using fixed bandwidth and gaussian kernel.\n\ngwr.fixed &lt;- gwr.basic(formula = SELLING_PRICE ~ AREA_SQM + AGE + PROX_CBD + \n                         PROX_CHILDCARE + PROX_ELDERLYCARE  + PROX_URA_GROWTH_AREA + \n                         PROX_MRT   + PROX_PARK + PROX_PRIMARY_SCH + \n                         PROX_SHOPPING_MALL + PROX_BUS_STOP + NO_Of_UNITS + \n                         FAMILY_FRIENDLY + FREEHOLD, \n                       data=condo_resale.sp, \n                       bw=bw.fixed, \n                       kernel = 'gaussian', \n                       longlat = FALSE)\n\nThe output is saved in a list of class “gwrm”.

In the presence of strong local collinearity, results become unstable. Results associated with condition numbers larger than 30, may be unreliable.\nLocal R2: these values range between 0.0 and 1.0 and indicate how well the local regression model fits observed y values. Very low values indicate the local model is performing poorly. Mapping the Local R2 values to see where GWR predicts well and where it predicts poorly may provide clues about important variables that may be missing from the regression model.\nPredicted: these are the estimated (or fitted) y values 3. computed by GWR.\nResiduals: to obtain the residual values, the fitted y values are subtracted from the observed y values. Standardized residuals have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of 1. A cold-to-hot rendered map of standardized residuals can be produce by using these values.\nCoefficient Standard Error: these values measure the reliability of each coefficient estimate. Confidence in those estimates are higher when standard errors are small in relation to the actual coefficient values. Large standard errors may indicate problems with local collinearity.\n\nThey are all stored in a SpatialPointsDataFrame or SpatialPolygonsDataFrame object integrated with fit.points, GWR coefficient estimates, y value, predicted values, coefficient standard errors and t-values in its “data” slot in an object called SDF of the output list.\n\n\n\nTo visualise the fields in SDF, we need to first covert it into sf data.frame by using the code chunk below.\n\ncondo_resale.sf.adaptive &lt;- st_as_sf(gwr.adaptive$SDF) %&gt;%\n  st_transform(crs=3414)\n\n\ncondo_resale.sf.adaptive.svy21 &lt;- st_transform(condo_resale.sf.adaptive, 3414)\ncondo_resale.sf.adaptive.svy21  \n\n\ngwr.adaptive.output &lt;- as.data.frame(gwr.adaptive$SDF)\ncondo_resale.sf.adaptive &lt;- cbind(condo_resale.res.sf, as.matrix(gwr.adaptive.output))\n\nNext, glimpse() is used to display the content of condo_resale.sf.adaptive sf data frame.\n\nglimpse(condo_resale.sf.adaptive)\n\n\nsummary(gwr.adaptive$SDF$yhat)\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunks below is used to create an interactive point symbol map.\n\ntmap_mode(\"view\")\ntm_shape(mpsz_svy21)+\n  tm_polygons(alpha = 0.1) +\ntm_shape(condo_resale.sf.adaptive) +  \n  tm_dots(col = \"Local_R2\",\n          border.col = \"gray60\",\n          border.lwd = 1) +\n  tm_view(set.zoom.limits = c(11,14))\n\nSet back to plotting mode\n\ntmap_mode(\"plot\")\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunks below is used to create an interactive point symbol map.\n\ntmap_mode(\"view\")\nAREA_SQM_SE &lt;- tm_shape(mpsz_svy21)+\n  tm_polygons(alpha = 0.1) +\ntm_shape(condo_resale.sf.adaptive) +  \n  tm_dots(col = \"AREA_SQM_SE\",\n          border.col = \"gray60\",\n          border.lwd = 1) +\n  tm_view(set.zoom.limits = c(11,14))\n\nAREA_SQM_TV &lt;- tm_shape(mpsz_svy21)+\n  tm_polygons(alpha = 0.1) +\ntm_shape(condo_resale.sf.adaptive) +  \n  tm_dots(col = \"AREA_SQM_TV\",\n          border.col = \"gray60\",\n          border.lwd = 1) +\n  tm_view(set.zoom.limits = c(11,14))\n\ntmap_arrange(AREA_SQM_SE, AREA_SQM_TV, \n             asp=1, ncol=2,\n             sync = TRUE)\n\nSet back to plotting mode\n\ntmap_mode(\"plot\")\n\n\n\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_svy21[mpsz_svy21$REGION_N==\"CENTRAL REGION\", ])+\n  tm_polygons()+\ntm_shape(condo_resale.sf.adaptive) + \n  tm_bubbles(col = \"Local_R2\",\n           size = 0.15,\n           border.col = \"gray60\",\n           border.lwd = 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGollini I, Lu B, Charlton M, Brunsdon C, Harris P (2015) “GWmodel: an R Package for exploring Spatial Heterogeneity using Geographically Weighted Models”.

    "text": "In this section, you will learn how to building hedonic pricing models for condominium resale units using lm() of R base.\n\n\nFirst, we will build a simple linear regression model by using SELLING_PRICE as the dependent variable and AREA_SQM as the independent variable.\n\ncondo.slr &lt;- lm(formula=SELLING_PRICE ~ AREA_SQM, data = condo_resale.sf)\n\nlm() returns an object of class “lm” or for multiple responses of class c(“mlm”, “lm”).\nThe functions summary() and anova() can be used to obtain and print a summary and analysis of variance table of the results. The generic accessor functions coefficients, effects, fitted.values and residuals extract various useful features of the value returned by lm.\n\nsummary(condo.slr)\n\nThe output report reveals that the SELLING_PRICE can be explained by using the formula:\n      *y = -258121.1 + 14719x1*\nThe R-squared of 0.4518 reveals that the simple regression model built is able to explain about 45% of the resale prices.\nSince p-value is much smaller than 0.0001, we will reject the null hypothesis that mean is a good estimator of SELLING_PRICE. This will allow us to infer that simple linear regression model above is a good estimator of SELLING_PRICE.\nThe Coefficients: section of the report reveals that the p-values of both the estimates of the Intercept and ARA_SQM are smaller than 0.001. In view of this, the null hypothesis of the B0 and B1 are equal to 0 will be rejected. As a results, we will be able to infer that the B0 and B1 are good parameter estimates.\nTo visualise the best fit curve on a scatterplot, we can incorporate lm() as a method function in ggplot’s geometry as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nggplot(data=condo_resale.sf,  \n       aes(x=`AREA_SQM`, y=`SELLING_PRICE`)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = lm)\n\nFigure above reveals that there are a few statistical outliers with relatively high selling prices.\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore building a multiple regression model, it is important to ensure that the indepdent variables used are not highly correlated to each other. If these highly correlated independent variables are used in building a regression model by mistake, the quality of the model will be compromised. This phenomenon is known as multicollinearity in statistics.\nCorrelation matrix is commonly used to visualise the relationships between the independent variables. Beside the pairs() of R, there are many packages support the display of a correlation matrix. In this section, the corrplot package will be used.\nThe code chunk below is used to plot a scatterplot matrix of the relationship between the independent variables in condo_resale data.frame.\n\ncorrplot(cor(condo_resale[, 5:23]), diag = FALSE, order = \"AOE\",\n         tl.pos = \"td\", tl.cex = 0.5, method = \"number\", type = \"upper\")\n\nMatrix reorder is very important for mining the hiden structure and patter in the matrix. There are four methods in corrplot (parameter order), named “AOE”, “FPC”, “hclust”, “alphabet”. In the code chunk above, AOE order is used. It orders the variables by using the angular order of the eigenvectors method suggested by Michael Friendly.\nFrom the scatterplot matrix, it is clear that Freehold is highly correlated to LEASE_99YEAR. In view of this, it is wiser to only include either one of them in the subsequent model building. As a result, LEASE_99YEAR is excluded in the subsequent model building.\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below using lm() to calibrate the multiple linear regression model.\n\ncondo.mlr &lt;- lm(formula = SELLING_PRICE ~ AREA_SQM + AGE    + \n                  PROX_CBD + PROX_CHILDCARE + PROX_ELDERLYCARE +\n                  PROX_URA_GROWTH_AREA + PROX_HAWKER_MARKET + PROX_KINDERGARTEN + \n                  PROX_MRT  + PROX_PARK + PROX_PRIMARY_SCH + \n                  PROX_TOP_PRIMARY_SCH + PROX_SHOPPING_MALL + PROX_SUPERMARKET + \n                  PROX_BUS_STOP + NO_Of_UNITS + FAMILY_FRIENDLY + FREEHOLD, \n                data=condo_resale.sf)\nsummary(condo.mlr)\n\n\n\n\nWith reference to the report above, it is clear that not all the independent variables are statistically significant.

It is called olsrr. It provides a collection of very useful methods for building better multiple linear regression models:\n\ncomprehensive regression output\nresidual diagnostics\nmeasures of influence\nheteroskedasticity tests\ncollinearity diagnostics\nmodel fit assessment\nvariable contribution assessment\nvariable selection procedures\n\nIn the code chunk below, the ols_vif_tol() of olsrr package is used to test if there are sign of multicollinearity.\n\nols_vif_tol(condo.mlr1)\n\nSince the VIF of the independent variables are less than 10. We can safely conclude that there are no sign of multicollinearity among the independent variables.\n\n\n\nIn multiple linear regression, it is important for us to test the assumption that linearity and additivity of the relationship between dependent and independent variables.\nIn the code chunk below, the ols_plot_resid_fit() of olsrr package is used to perform linearity assumption test.\n\nols_plot_resid_fit(condo.mlr1)\n\nThe figure above reveals that most of the data poitns are scattered around the 0 line, hence we can safely conclude that the relationships between the dependent variable and independent variables are linear.\n\n\n\nLastly, the code chunk below uses ols_plot_resid_hist() of olsrr package to perform normality assumption test.\n\nols_plot_resid_hist(condo.mlr1)\n\nThe figure reveals that the residual of the multiple linear regression model (i.e. condo.mlr1) is resemble normal distribution.\nIf you prefer formal statistical test methods, the ols_test_normality() of olsrr package can be used as shown in the code chun below.\n\nols_test_normality(condo.mlr1)\n\nThe summary table above reveals that the p-values of the four tests are way smaller than the alpha value of 0.05. Hence we will reject the null hypothesis and infer that there is statistical evidence that the residual are not normally distributed.\n\n\n\nThe hedonic model we try to build are using geographically referenced attributes, hence it is also important for us to visual the residual of the hedonic pricing model.\nIn order to perform spatial autocorrelation test, we need to convert condo_resale.sf from sf data frame into a SpatialPointsDataFrame.\nFirst, we will export the residual of the hedonic pricing model and save it as a data frame.\n\nmlr.output &lt;- as.data.frame(condo.mlr1$residuals)\n\nNext, we will join the newly created data frame with condo_resale.sf object.\n\ncondo_resale.res.sf &lt;- cbind(condo_resale.sf, \n                        condo.mlr1$residuals) %&gt;%\nrename(`MLR_RES` = `condo.mlr1.residuals`)\n\nNext, we will convert condo_resale.res.sf from simple feature object into a SpatialPointsDataFrame because spdep package can only process sp conformed spatial data objects.\nThe code chunk below will be used to perform the data conversion process.\n\ncondo_resale.sp &lt;- as_Spatial(condo_resale.res.sf)\ncondo_resale.sp\n\nNext, we will use tmap package to display the distribution of the residuals on an interactive map.\nThe code churn below will turn on the interactive mode of tmap.\n\ntmap_mode(\"view\")\n\nThe code chunks below is used to create an interactive point symbol map.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_svy21)+\n  tmap_options(check.and.fix = TRUE) +\n  tm_polygons(alpha = 0.4) +\ntm_shape(condo_resale.res.sf) +  \n  tm_dots(col = \"MLR_RES\",\n          alpha = 0.6,\n          style=\"quantile\") +\n  tm_view(set.zoom.limits = c(11,14))\n\nRemember to switch back to “plot” mode before continue.\n\ntmap_mode(\"plot\")\n\nThe figure above reveal that there is sign of spatial autocorrelation.\nTo proof that our observation is indeed true, the Moran’s I test will be performed\nFirst, we will compute the distance-based weight matrix by using dnearneigh() function of spdep.\n\nnb &lt;- dnearneigh(coordinates(condo_resale.sp), 0, 1500, longlat = FALSE)\nsummary(nb)\n\nNext, nb2listw() of spdep packge will be used to convert the output neighbours lists (i.e. nb) into a spatial weights.\n\nnb_lw &lt;- nb2listw(nb, style = 'W')\nsummary(nb_lw)\n\nNext, lm.morantest() of spdep package will be used to perform Moran’s I test for residual spatial autocorrelation\n\nlm.morantest(condo.mlr1, nb_lw)\n\nThe Global Moran’s I test for residual spatial autocorrelation shows that it’s p-value is less than 0.00000000000000022 which is less than the alpha value of 0.05. Hence, we will reject the null hypothesis that the residuals are randomly distributed.\nSince the Observed Global Moran I = 0.1424418 which is greater than 0, we can infer than the residuals resemble cluster distribution."

    "text": "In this section, you are going to learn how to modelling hedonic pricing using both the fixed and adaptive bandwidth schemes\n\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below bw.gwr() of GWModel package is used to determine the optimal fixed bandwidth to use in the model. Notice that the argument adaptive is set to FALSE indicates that we are interested to compute the fixed bandwidth.\nThere are two possible approaches can be uused to determine the stopping rule, they are: CV cross-validation approach and AIC corrected (AICc) approach. We define the stopping rule using approach argeement.\n\nbw.fixed &lt;- bw.gwr(formula = SELLING_PRICE ~ AREA_SQM + AGE + PROX_CBD + \n                     PROX_CHILDCARE + PROX_ELDERLYCARE  + PROX_URA_GROWTH_AREA + \n                     PROX_MRT   + PROX_PARK + PROX_PRIMARY_SCH + \n                     PROX_SHOPPING_MALL + PROX_BUS_STOP + NO_Of_UNITS + \n                     FAMILY_FRIENDLY + FREEHOLD, \n                   data=condo_resale.sp, \n                   approach=\"CV\", \n                   kernel=\"gaussian\", \n                   adaptive=FALSE, \n                   longlat=FALSE)\n\nThe result shows that the recommended bandwidth is 971.3405 metres.\nQuiz: Do you know why it is in metre?\nThe bandwidth in this case is measured in meters because the longlat=FALSE argument was set in the spatial analysis function.\nBy default, many spatial libraries use geographic coordinates (longitude and latitude) when longlat=TRUE, meaning that distances are interpreted in angular units (degrees). However, when longlat=FALSE, the analysis assumes a projected coordinate system where distances are measured in linear units like meters or kilometers, which is common for accurate spatial distance measurements in GIS.\nIn other words, the analysis is performed in a projected coordinate system, such as UTM where the units are in meters. This is essential for accurate distance-based calculations, like kernel density estimation, which would be incorrect if the distances were interpreted in degrees.\nSo, the bandwidth is in meters because the spatial data has been projected into a system that uses meters as the unit of measurement.\n\n\n\nNow we can use the code chunk below to calibrate the gwr model using fixed bandwidth and gaussian kernel.\n\ngwr.fixed &lt;- gwr.basic(formula = SELLING_PRICE ~ AREA_SQM + AGE + PROX_CBD + \n                         PROX_CHILDCARE + PROX_ELDERLYCARE  + PROX_URA_GROWTH_AREA + \n                         PROX_MRT   + PROX_PARK + PROX_PRIMARY_SCH + \n                         PROX_SHOPPING_MALL + PROX_BUS_STOP + NO_Of_UNITS + \n                         FAMILY_FRIENDLY + FREEHOLD, \n                       data=condo_resale.sp, \n                       bw=bw.fixed, \n                       kernel = 'gaussian', \n                       longlat = FALSE)\n\nThe output is saved in a list of class “gwrm”. The code below can be used to display the model output.\n\ngwr.fixed\n\nThe report shows that the AICc of the gwr is 42263.61 which is significantly smaller than the globel multiple linear regression model of 42967.1.\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, we will calibrate the gwr-based hedonic pricing model by using adaptive bandwidth approach.\n\n\nSimilar to the earlier section, we will first use bw.gwr() to determine the recommended data point to use.\nThe code chunk used look very similar to the one used to compute the fixed bandwidth except the adaptive argument has changed to TRUE.\n\nbw.adaptive &lt;- bw.gwr(formula = SELLING_PRICE ~ AREA_SQM + AGE  + \n                        PROX_CBD + PROX_CHILDCARE + PROX_ELDERLYCARE    + \n                        PROX_URA_GROWTH_AREA + PROX_MRT + PROX_PARK + \n                        PROX_PRIMARY_SCH + PROX_SHOPPING_MALL   + PROX_BUS_STOP + \n                        NO_Of_UNITS + FAMILY_FRIENDLY + FREEHOLD, \n                      data=condo_resale.sp, \n                      approach=\"CV\", \n                      kernel=\"gaussian\", \n                      adaptive=TRUE, \n                      longlat=FALSE)\n\nThe result shows that the 30 is the recommended data points to be used.\n\n\n\nNow, we can go ahead to calibrate the gwr-based hedonic pricing model by using adaptive bandwidth and gaussian kernel as shown in the code chunk below.\n\ngwr.adaptive &lt;- gwr.basic(formula = SELLING_PRICE ~ AREA_SQM + AGE + \n                            PROX_CBD + PROX_CHILDCARE + PROX_ELDERLYCARE + \n                            PROX_URA_GROWTH_AREA + PROX_MRT + PROX_PARK + \n                            PROX_PRIMARY_SCH + PROX_SHOPPING_MALL + PROX_BUS_STOP + \n                            NO_Of_UNITS + FAMILY_FRIENDLY + FREEHOLD, \n                          data=condo_resale.sp, bw=bw.adaptive, \n                          kernel = 'gaussian', \n                          adaptive=TRUE, \n                          longlat = FALSE)\n\nThe code below can be used to display the model output.\n\ngwr.adaptive\n\nThe report shows that the AICc the adaptive distance gwr is 41982.22 which is even smaller than the AICc of the fixed distance gwr of 42263.61.\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to regression residuals, the output feature class table includes fields for observed and predicted y values, condition number (cond), Local R2, residuals, and explanatory variable coefficients and standard errors:\n\nCondition Number: this diagnostic evaluates local collinearity. In the presence of strong local collinearity, results become unstable. Results associated with condition numbers larger than 30, may be unreliable.\nLocal R2: these values range between 0.0 and 1.0 and indicate how well the local regression model fits observed y values. Very low values indicate the local model is performing poorly. Mapping the Local R2 values to see where GWR predicts well and where it predicts poorly may provide clues about important variables that may be missing from the regression model.\nPredicted: these are the estimated (or fitted) y values 3. computed by GWR.\nResiduals: to obtain the residual values, the fitted y values are subtracted from the observed y values. Standardized residuals have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of 1. A cold-to-hot rendered map of standardized residuals can be produce by using these values.\nCoefficient Standard Error: these values measure the reliability of each coefficient estimate. Confidence in those estimates are higher when standard errors are small in relation to the actual coefficient values. Large standard errors may indicate problems with local collinearity.\n\nThey are all stored in a SpatialPointsDataFrame or SpatialPolygonsDataFrame object integrated with fit.points, GWR coefficient estimates, y value, predicted values, coefficient standard errors and t-values in its “data” slot in an object called SDF of the output list.\n\n\n\nTo visualise the fields in SDF, we need to first covert it into sf data.frame by using the code chunk below.\n\ncondo_resale.sf.adaptive &lt;- st_as_sf(gwr.adaptive$SDF) %&gt;%\n  st_transform(crs=3414)\n\n\ncondo_resale.sf.adaptive.svy21 &lt;- st_transform(condo_resale.sf.adaptive, 3414)\ncondo_resale.sf.adaptive.svy21  \n\n\ngwr.adaptive.output &lt;- as.data.frame(gwr.adaptive$SDF)\ncondo_resale.sf.adaptive &lt;- cbind(condo_resale.res.sf, as.matrix(gwr.adaptive.output))\n\nNext, glimpse() is used to display the content of condo_resale.sf.adaptive sf data frame.\n\nglimpse(condo_resale.sf.adaptive)\n\n\nsummary(gwr.adaptive$SDF$yhat)\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunks below is used to create an interactive point symbol map.\n\ntmap_mode(\"view\")\ntm_shape(mpsz_svy21)+\n  tm_polygons(alpha = 0.1) +\ntm_shape(condo_resale.sf.adaptive) +  \n  tm_dots(col = \"Local_R2\",\n          border.col = \"gray60\",\n          border.lwd = 1) +\n  tm_view(set.zoom.limits = c(11,14))\n\nSet back to plotting mode\n\ntmap_mode(\"plot\")\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunks below is used to create an interactive point symbol map.\n\ntmap_mode(\"view\")\nAREA_SQM_SE &lt;- tm_shape(mpsz_svy21)+\n  tm_polygons(alpha = 0.1) +\ntm_shape(condo_resale.sf.adaptive) +  \n  tm_dots(col = \"AREA_SQM_SE\",\n          border.col = \"gray60\",\n          border.lwd = 1) +\n  tm_view(set.zoom.limits = c(11,14))\n\nAREA_SQM_TV &lt;- tm_shape(mpsz_svy21)+\n  tm_polygons(alpha = 0.1) +\ntm_shape(condo_resale.sf.adaptive) +  \n  tm_dots(col = \"AREA_SQM_TV\",\n          border.col = \"gray60\",\n          border.lwd = 1) +\n  tm_view(set.zoom.limits = c(11,14))\n\ntmap_arrange(AREA_SQM_SE, AREA_SQM_TV, \n             asp=1, ncol=2,\n             sync = TRUE)\n\nSet back to plotting mode\n\ntmap_mode(\"plot\")\n\n\n\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_svy21[mpsz_svy21$REGION_N==\"CENTRAL REGION\", ])+\n  tm_polygons()+\ntm_shape(condo_resale.sf.adaptive) + \n  tm_bubbles(col = \"Local_R2\",\n           size = 0.15,\n           border.col = \"gray60\",\n           border.lwd = 1)"

The data table should include the variables PA, SZ, YOUNG, ECONOMY ACTIVE, AGED, TOTAL, DEPENDENCY.\n\nYOUNG: age group 0 to 4 until age groyup 20 to 24,\nECONOMY ACTIVE: age group 25-29 until age group 60-64,\nAGED: age group 65 and above,\nTOTAL: all age group, and\nDEPENDENCY: the ratio between young and aged against economy active group\n\nThe original code is\nr``library(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidyr)\npopdata2020 &lt;- popdata %&gt;%\nfilter(Time == 2020) %&gt;%\ngroup_by(PA, SZ, AG) %&gt;%\nsummarise(`POP` = sum(`Pop`)) %&gt;%\nungroup()%&gt;%\npivot_wider(names_from=AG,\nvalues_from=POP) %&gt;%\nmutate(YOUNG = rowSums(.[3:6])\n+rowSums(.[12])) %&gt;%\nmutate(`ECONOMY ACTIVE` = rowSums(.[7:11])+\nrowSums(.[13:15]))%&gt;%\nmutate(`AGED`=rowSums(.[16:21])) %&gt;%\nmutate(`TOTAL`=rowSums(.[3:21])) %&gt;%\nmutate(`DEPENDENCY` = (`YOUNG` + `AGED`)\n/`ECONOMY ACTIVE`) %&gt;%\nselect(`PA`, `SZ`, `YOUNG`,\n`ECONOMY ACTIVE`, `AGED`,\n`TOTAL`, `DEPENDENCY`)\nThe following take in data for young FROM 0-24 and 50 to 54 which is wrong as rowSums(.[12]) is the age group 50 to 54.\nTherefore the amended code should be\nmutate(YOUNG = rowSums(.[3:6]))\nFurthermore, the orignial code takes in ECONOMY ACTIVE takes in 24-49 and skip 50-54 and takes in 5_to_9 instead which is wrong as ECONOMY ACTIVE 25 to 64\nTherefore the amended code is\nmutate(ECONOMY ACTIVE = rowSums(.[7:13])+ rowSums(.[15]))\n\n\nThe following data wrangling and transformation functions will be used:\n\npivot_wider() of tidyr package, and\nmutate(), filter(), group_by() and select() of dplyr package\n\n\npopdata2020 &lt;- popdata %&gt;%\n  filter(Time == 2020) %&gt;%\n  group_by(PA, SZ, AG) %&gt;%\n  summarise(`POP` = sum(`Pop`)) %&gt;%\n  ungroup()%&gt;%\n  pivot_wider(names_from=AG, \n              values_from=POP) %&gt;%\n  mutate(YOUNG = rowSums(.[3:6])) %&gt;%\nmutate(`ECONOMY ACTIVE` = rowSums(.[7:13])+\nrowSums(.[15]))%&gt;%\nmutate(`AGED`=rowSums(.[16:21])) %&gt;%\nmutate(`TOTAL`=rowSums(.[3:21])) %&gt;%  \nmutate(`DEPENDENCY` = (`YOUNG` + `AGED`)\n/`ECONOMY ACTIVE`) %&gt;%\n  select(`PA`, `SZ`, `YOUNG`, \n       `ECONOMY ACTIVE`, `AGED`, \n       `TOTAL`, `DEPENDENCY`)\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'PA', 'SZ'. You can override using the\n`.groups` argument.\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore we can perform the georelational join, one extra step is required to convert the values in PA and SZ fields to uppercase. This is because the values of PA and SZ fields are made up of upper- and lowercase. On the other, hand the SUBZONE_N and PLN_AREA_N are in uppercase.\n\npopdata2020 &lt;- popdata2020 %&gt;%\n  mutate_at(.vars = vars(PA, SZ), \n          .funs = list(toupper)) %&gt;%\n  filter(`ECONOMY ACTIVE` &gt; 0)\n\nNext, left_join() of dplyr is used to join the geographical data and attribute table using planning subzone name e.g. SUBZONE_N and SZ as the common identifier.\n\nmpsz_pop2020 &lt;- left_join(mpsz, popdata2020,\n                          by = c(\"SUBZONE_N\" = \"SZ\"))\n\nThing to learn from the code chunk above:\n\nleft_join() of dplyr package is used with mpsz simple feature data frame as the left data table is to ensure that the output will be a simple features data frame.\n\n\nwrite_rds(mpsz_pop2020, \"data/rds/mpszpop2020.rds\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChoropleth mapping involves the symbolisation of enumeration units, such as countries, provinces, states, counties or census units, using area patterns or graduated colors. For example, a social scientist may need to use a choropleth map to portray the spatial distribution of aged population of Singapore by Master Plan 2014 Subzone Boundary.\nTwo approaches can be used to prepare thematic map using tmap, they are:\n\nPlotting a thematic map quickly by using qtm().\nPlotting highly customisable thematic map by using tmap elements.\n\n\n\nThe easiest and quickest to draw a choropleth map using tmap is using qtm(). It is concise and provides a good default visualisation in many cases.\nThe code chunk below will draw a cartographic standard choropleth map as shown below.\n\ntmap_mode(\"plot\")\n\ntmap mode set to plotting\n\nqtm(mpsz_pop2020, \n    fill = \"DEPENDENCY\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk above:\n\ntmap_mode() with “plot” option is used to produce a static map. For interactive mode, “view” option should be used.\nfill argument is used to map the attribute (i.e. DEPENDENCY)\n\n\n\n\nDespite its usefulness of drawing a choropleth map quickly and easily, the disadvantge of qtm() is that it makes aesthetics of individual layers harder to control. To draw a high quality cartographic choropleth map as shown in the figure below, tmap’s drawing elements should be used.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\", \n          style = \"quantile\", \n          palette = \"Blues\",\n          title = \"Dependency ratio\") +\n  tm_layout(main.title = \"Distribution of Dependency Ratio by planning subzone\",\n            main.title.position = \"center\",\n            main.title.size = 1.2,\n            legend.height = 0.45, \n            legend.width = 0.35,\n            frame = TRUE) +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +\n  tm_compass(type=\"8star\", size = 2) +\n  tm_scale_bar() +\n  tm_grid(alpha =0.2) +\n  tm_credits(\"Source: Planning Sub-zone boundary from Urban Redevelopment Authorithy (URA)\\n and Population data from Department of Statistics DOS\", \n             position = c(\"left\", \"bottom\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the following sub-section, we will share with you tmap functions that used to plot these elements.\n\n\nThe basic building block of tmap is tm_shape() followed by one or more layer elemments such as tm_fill() and tm_polygons().\nIn the code chunk below, tm_shape() is used to define the input data (i.e mpsz_pop2020) and tm_polygons() is used to draw the planning subzone polygons\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020) +\n  tm_polygons()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo draw a choropleth map showing the geographical distribution of a selected variable by planning subzone, we just need to assign the target variable such as Dependency to tm_polygons().\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_polygons(\"DEPENDENCY\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from tm_polygons():\n\nThe default interval binning used to draw the choropleth map is called “pretty”. A detailed discussion of the data classification methods supported by tmap will be provided in sub-section 4.3.\nThe default colour scheme used is YlOrRd of ColorBrewer. You will learn more about the color scheme in sub-section 4.4.\nBy default, Missing value will be shaded in grey.\n\n\n\n\nActually, tm_polygons() is a wraper of tm_fill() and tm_border(). tm_fill() shades the polygons by using the default colour scheme and tm_borders() adds the borders of the shapefile onto the choropleth map.\nThe code chunk below draws a choropleth map by using tm_fill() alone.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the planning subzones are shared according to the respective dependecy values\nTo add the boundary of the planning subzones, tm_borders will be used as shown in the code chunk below.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\") +\n  tm_borders(lwd = 0.1,  alpha = 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that light-gray border lines have been added on the choropleth map.\nThe alpha argument is used to define transparency number between 0 (totally transparent) and 1 (not transparent). By default, the alpha value of the col is used (normally 1).\nBeside alpha argument, there are three other arguments for tm_borders(), they are:\n\ncol = border colour,\nlwd = border line width. The default is 1, and\nlty = border line type. The default is “solid”.\n\n\n\n\n\nMost choropleth maps employ some methods of data classification. The point of classification is to take a large number of observations and group them into data ranges or classes.\ntmap provides a total ten data classification methods, namely: fixed, sd, equal, pretty (default), quantile, kmeans, hclust, bclust, fisher, and jenks.\nTo define a data classification method, the style argument of tm_fill() or tm_polygons() will be used.\n\n\nThe code chunk below shows a quantile data classification that used 5 classes.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\",\n          n = 5,\n          style = \"quantile\") +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, equal data classification method is used.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\",\n          n = 5,\n          style = \"equal\") +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the distribution of quantile data classification method are more evenly distributed then equal data classification method.\n\nWarning: Maps Lie!\n\n\nDIY: Using what you had learned, prepare choropleth maps by using different classification methods supported by tmap and compare their differences\n\n\n# Equal Interval Classification\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020) +\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\", n = 5, style = \"equal\") +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +\n  tm_layout(title = \"Equal Interval\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Quantile Classification\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020) +\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\", n = 5, style = \"quantile\") +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +\n  tm_layout(title = \"Quantile\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Jenks Natural Breaks Classification\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020) +\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\", n = 5, style = \"jenks\") +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +\n  tm_layout(title = \"Jenks Natural Breaks\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Fisher-Jenks Classification\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020) +\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\", n = 5, style = \"fisher\") +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +\n  tm_layout(title = \"Fisher-Jenks\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Standard Deviation Classification\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020) +\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\", n = 5, style = \"sd\") +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +\n  tm_layout(title = \"Standard Deviation\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEqual Interval: Simplifies the interpretation but can miss important data distributions.\nQuantile: Ensures balance in the number of observations per class but can obscure variation in the actual values.\nJenks/Fisher: Highlights clusters and natural breaks in the data but is more complex.\nStandard Deviation: Good for analyzing deviations from the mean, showing how values differ across the dataset.\n\nDIY: Preparing choropleth maps by using similar classification method but with different numbers of classes (i.e. 2, 6, 10, 20). Compare the output maps, what observation can you draw?\nWhen preparing choropleth maps with different numbers of classes (e.g., 2, 6, 10, 20), you are essentially altering the granularity of the information presented.\n\nTwo Classes:\n\nObservation: The map will be quite simplistic, likely resulting in large areas of the same color. This means that the map will not convey detailed variations within the data; instead, it will show broad categories. This might be useful for high-level overviews but lacks nuance.\n\nSix Classes:\n\nObservation: The map starts to show more distinctions between different areas. With six classes, you get a better sense of the variability in the data. This level of classification is often useful for intermediate analysis, where some detail is needed but not too much to overwhelm the viewer.\n\nTen Classes:\n\nObservation: The map will have even more detailed variations, allowing for finer distinctions between different regions. This can be useful for in-depth analysis and can help to reveal subtler patterns or anomalies in the data.\n\nTwenty Classes:\n\nObservation: The map will be very detailed, with many different shades or colors. While this provides the most detailed view, it can sometimes be overwhelming or difficult to interpret. It’s crucial to ensure that the map remains readable and that the distinctions between classes are meaningful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor all the built-in styles, the category breaks are computed internally. In order to override these defaults, the breakpoints can be set explicitly by means of the breaks argument to the tm_fill(). It is important to note that, in tmap the breaks include a minimum and maximum. As a result, in order to end up with n categories, n+1 elements must be specified in the breaks option (the values must be in increasing order).\nBefore we get started, it is always a good practice to get some descriptive statistics on the variable before setting the break points. Code chunk below will be used to compute and display the descriptive statistics of DEPENDENCY field.\n\nsummary(mpsz_pop2020$DEPENDENCY)\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max.    NA's \n 0.0000  0.5696  0.6154  0.6917  0.6950 19.0000      92 \n\n\nWith reference to the results above, we set break point at 0.60, 0.70, 0.80, and 0.90. In addition, we also need to include a minimum and maximum, which we set at 0 and 100. Our breaks vector is thus c(0, 0.60, 0.70, 0.80, 0.90, 1.00)\nNow, we will plot the choropleth map by using the code chunk below.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\",\n          breaks = c(0, 0.60, 0.70, 0.80, 0.90, 1.00)) +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)\n\nWarning: Values have found that are higher than the highest break\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.4.4 Colour Scheme\ntmap supports colour ramps either defined by the user or a set of predefined colour ramps from the RColorBrewer package.\n\n\n\nTo change the colour, we assign the preferred colour to palette argument of tm_fill() as shown in the code chunk below.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\",\n          n = 6,\n          style = \"quantile\",\n          palette = \"Blues\") +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the choropleth map is shaded in green.\nTo reverse the colour shading, add a “-” prefix.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\",\n          style = \"quantile\",\n          palette = \"-Greens\") +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the colour scheme has been reversed.\n\n\n\n\nMap layout refers to the combination of all map elements into a cohensive map.

    "text": "Local Measures of Spatial Autocorrelation (LMSA) focus on the relationships between each observation and its surroundings, rather than providing a single summary of these relationships across the map. In this sense, they are not summary statistics but scores that allow us to learn more about the spatial structure in our data. The general intuition behind the metrics however is similar to that of global ones. Some of them are even mathematically connected, where the global version can be decomposed into a collection of local ones. One such example are Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA). Beside LISA, Getis-Ord’s Gi-statistics will be introduce as an alternative LMSA statistics that present complementary information or allow us to obtain similar insights for geographically referenced data.\nIn this hands-on exercise, you will learn how to compute Local Measures of Spatial Autocorrelation (LMSA) by using spdep package. By the end to this hands-on exercise, you will be able to:\n\nimport geospatial data using appropriate function(s) of sf package,\nimport csv file using appropriate function of readr package,\nperform relational join using appropriate join function of dplyr package,\ncompute Local Indicator of Spatial Association (LISA) statistics for detecting clusters and outliers by using appropriate functions spdep package;\ncompute Getis-Ord’s Gi-statistics for detecting hot spot or/and cold spot area by using appropriate functions of spdep package; and\nto visualise the analysis output by using tmap package.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn spatial policy, one of the main development objective of the local govenment and planners is to ensure equal distribution of development in the province. Our task in this study, hence, is to apply appropriate spatial statistical methods to discover if development are even distributed geographically. If the answer is No. Then, our next question will be “is there sign of spatial clustering?”. And, if the answer for this question is yes, then our next question will be “where are these clusters?”\nIn this case study, we are interested to examine the spatial pattern of a selected development indicator (i.e. GDP per capita) of Hunan Provice, People Republic of China.(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunan)\n\n\n\nTwo data sets will be used in this hands-on exercise, they are:\n\nHunan province administrative boundary layer at county level. This is a geospatial data set in ESRI shapefile format.\nHunan_2012.csv: This csv file contains selected Hunan’s local development indicators in 2012.\n\n\n\n\nBefore we get started, we need to ensure that spdep, sf, tmap and tidyverse packages of R are currently installed in your R.\n\nsf is use for importing and handling geospatial data in R,\ntidyverse is mainly use for wrangling attribute data in R,\nspdep will be used to compute spatial weights, global and local spatial autocorrelation statistics, and\ntmap will be used to prepare cartographic quality chropleth map.\n\nThe code chunk below is used to perform the following tasks:\n\ncreating a package list containing the necessary R packages,\nchecking if the R packages in the package list have been installed in R,\n\nif they have yet to be installed, RStudio will installed the missing packages,\n\nlaunching the packages into R environment.\n\n\npacman::p_load(sf, spdep, tmap, tidyverse)\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, you will learn how to bring a geospatial data and its associated attribute table into R environment. The geospatial data is in ESRI shapefile format and the attribute table is in csv fomat.\n\n\nThe code chunk below uses st_read() of sf package to import Hunan shapefile into R. The imported shapefile will be simple features Object of sf.\n\nhunan &lt;- st_read(dsn = \"data/geospatial\", \n                 layer = \"Hunan\")\n\nReading layer `Hunan' from data source \n  `C:\\edwing444\\IS415-GAA\\Hands_On_Ex\\Hands_On_Ex6\\data\\geospatial' \n  using driver `ESRI Shapefile'\nSimple feature collection with 88 features and 7 fields\nGeometry type: POLYGON\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 108.7831 ymin: 24.6342 xmax: 114.2544 ymax: 30.12812\nGeodetic CRS:  WGS 84\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we will import Hunan_2012.csv into R by using read_csv() of readr package. The output is R data frame class.\n\nhunan2012 &lt;- read_csv(\"data/aspatial/Hunan_2012.csv\")\n\nRows: 88 Columns: 29\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr  (2): County, City\ndbl (27): avg_wage, deposite, FAI, Gov_Rev, Gov_Exp, GDP, GDPPC, GIO, Loan, ...\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below will be used to update the attribute table of hunan’s SpatialPolygonsDataFrame with the attribute fields of hunan2012 dataframe. This is performed by using left_join() of dplyr package.\n\nhunan &lt;- left_join(hunan,hunan2012) %&gt;%\n  dplyr::select(1:4, 7, 15)\n\nJoining with `by = join_by(County)`\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, we are going to prepare a basemap and a choropleth map showing the distribution of GDPPC 2012 by using qtm() of tmap package.\n\nequal &lt;- tm_shape(hunan) +\n  tm_fill(\"GDPPC\",\n          n = 5,\n          style = \"equal\") +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +\n  tm_layout(main.title = \"Equal interval classification\")\n\nquantile &lt;- tm_shape(hunan) +\n  tm_fill(\"GDPPC\",\n          n = 5,\n          style = \"quantile\") +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +\n  tm_layout(main.title = \"Equal quantile classification\")\n\ntmap_arrange(equal, \n             quantile, \n             asp=1, \n             ncol=2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLocal Indicators of Spatial Association or LISA are statistics that evaluate the existence of clusters and/or outliers in the spatial arrangement of a given variable. For instance if we are studying distribution of GDP per capita of Hunan Provice, People Republic of China, local clusters in GDP per capita mean that there are counties that have higher or lower rates than is to be expected by chance alone; that is, the values occurring are above or below those of a random distribution in space.\nIn this section, you will learn how to apply appropriate Local Indicators for Spatial Association (LISA), especially local Moran’I to detect cluster and/or outlier from GDP per capita 2012 of Hunan Province, PRC.\n\n\nBefore we can compute the local spatial autocorrelation statistics, we need to construct a spatial weights of the study area. The spatial weights is used to define the neighbourhood relationships between the geographical units (i.e. county) in the study area.\nIn the code chunk below, poly2nb() of spdep package is used to compute contiguity weight matrices for the study area. This function builds a neighbours list based on regions with contiguous boundaries. If you look at the documentation you will see that you can pass a “queen” argument that takes TRUE or FALSE as options. If you do not specify this argument the default is set to TRUE, that is, if you don’t specify queen = FALSE this function will return a list of first order neighbours using the Queen criteria.\nMore specifically, the code chunk below is used to compute Queen contiguity weight matrix.\n\nwm_q &lt;- poly2nb(hunan, \n                queen=TRUE)\nsummary(wm_q)\n\nNeighbour list object:\nNumber of regions: 88 \nNumber of nonzero links: 448 \nPercentage nonzero weights: 5.785124 \nAverage number of links: 5.090909 \nLink number distribution:\n\n 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 11 \n 2  2 12 16 24 14 11  4  2  1 \n2 least connected regions:\n30 65 with 1 link\n1 most connected region:\n85 with 11 links\n\n\nThe summary report above shows that there are 88 area units in Hunan. The most connected area unit has 11 neighbours. There are two area units with only one neighbours.\n\n\n\nNext, we need to assign weights to each neighboring polygon. In our case, each neighboring polygon will be assigned equal weight (style=“W”). This is accomplished by assigning the fraction 1/(#ofneighbors) to each neighboring county then summing the weighted income values. While this is the most intuitive way to summaries the neighbors’ values it has one drawback in that polygons along the edges of the study area will base their lagged values on fewer polygons thus potentially over- or under-estimating the true nature of the spatial autocorrelation in the data. For this example, we’ll stick with the style=“W” option for simplicity’s sake but note that other more robust options are available, notably style=“B”.\n\nrswm_q &lt;- nb2listw(wm_q, \n                   style=\"W\", \n                   zero.policy = TRUE)\nrswm_q\n\nCharacteristics of weights list object:\nNeighbour list object:\nNumber of regions: 88 \nNumber of nonzero links: 448 \nPercentage nonzero weights: 5.785124 \nAverage number of links: 5.090909 \n\nWeights style: W \nWeights constants summary:\n   n   nn S0       S1       S2\nW 88 7744 88 37.86334 365.9147\n\n\nWhat can we learn from the code chunk above?\n\nThe input of nb2listw() must be an object of class nb. The syntax of the function has two major arguments, namely style and zero.poly.\nstyle can take values “W”, “B”, “C”, “U”, “minmax” and “S”. B is the basic binary coding, W is row standardised (sums over all links to n), C is globally standardised (sums over all links to n), U is equal to C divided by the number of neighbours (sums over all links to unity), while S is the variance-stabilizing coding scheme proposed by Tiefelsdorf et al. 1999, p. 167-168 (sums over all links to n).\nIf zero policy is set to TRUE, weights vectors of zero length are inserted for regions without neighbour in the neighbours list. These will in turn generate lag values of zero, equivalent to the sum of products of the zero row t(rep(0, length=length(neighbours))) %*% x, for arbitrary numerical vector x of length length(neighbours). The spatially lagged value of x for the zero-neighbour region will then be zero, which may (or may not) be a sensible choice.\n\n\n\n\nTo compute local Moran’s I, the localmoran() function of spdep will be used. It computes Ii values, given a set of zi values and a listw object providing neighbour weighting information for the polygon associated with the zi values.\nThe code chunks below are used to compute local Moran’s I of GDPPC2012 at the county level\n\nfips &lt;- order(hunan$County)\nlocalMI &lt;- localmoran(hunan$GDPPC, rswm_q)\nhead(localMI)\n\n            Ii          E.Ii       Var.Ii

Moran’s I map, it is wise to append the local Moran’s I dataframe (i.e. localMI) onto hunan SpatialPolygonDataFrame. The code chunks below can be used to perform the task. The out SpatialPolygonDataFrame is called hunan.localMI.\n\nhunan.localMI &lt;- cbind(hunan,localMI) %&gt;%\n  rename(Pr.Ii = Pr.z....E.Ii..)\n\n\n\n\nUsing choropleth mapping functions of tmap package, we can plot the local Moran’s I values by using the code chinks below.\n\ntm_shape(hunan.localMI) +\n  tm_fill(col = \"Ii\", \n          style = \"pretty\",\n          palette = \"RdBu\",\n          title = \"local moran statistics\") +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)\n\nVariable(s) \"Ii\" contains positive and negative values, so midpoint is set to 0. Set midpoint = NA to show the full spectrum of the color palette.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe choropleth shows there is evidence for both positive and negative Ii values. However, it is useful to consider the p-values for each of these values, as consider above.\nThe code chunks below produce a choropleth map of Moran’s I p-values by using functions of tmap package.\n\ntm_shape(hunan.localMI) +\n  tm_fill(col = \"Pr.Ii\", \n          breaks=c(-Inf, 0.001, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, Inf),\n          palette=\"-Blues\", \n          title = \"local Moran's I p-values\") +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe choropleth shows there is evidence for both positive and negative Ii values. However, it is useful to consider the p-values for each of these values, as consider above.\nThe code chunks below produce a choropleth map of Moran’s I p-values by using functions of tmap package.\n\ntm_shape(hunan.localMI) +\n  tm_fill(col = \"Pr.Ii\", \n          breaks=c(-Inf, 0.001, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, Inf),\n          palette=\"-Blues\", \n          title = \"local Moran's I p-values\") +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor effective interpretation, it is better to plot both the local Moran’s I values map and its corresponding p-values map next to each other.\nThe code chunk below will be used to create such visualisation.\n\nlocalMI.map &lt;- tm_shape(hunan.localMI) +\n  tm_fill(col = \"Ii\", \n          style = \"pretty\", \n          title = \"local moran statistics\") +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)\n\npvalue.map &lt;- tm_shape(hunan.localMI) +\n  tm_fill(col = \"Pr.Ii\", \n          breaks=c(-Inf, 0.001, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, Inf),\n          palette=\"-Blues\", \n          title = \"local Moran's I p-values\") +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)\n\ntmap_arrange(localMI.map, pvalue.map, asp=1, ncol=2)\n\nVariable(s) \"Ii\" contains positive and negative values, so midpoint is set to 0. Set midpoint = NA to show the full spectrum of the color palette.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe LISA Cluster Map shows the significant locations color coded by type of spatial autocorrelation. The first step before we can generate the LISA cluster map is to plot the Moran scatterplot.\n\n\nThe Moran scatterplot is an illustration of the relationship between the values of the chosen attribute at each location and the average value of the same attribute at neighboring locations.\nThe code chunk below plots the Moran scatterplot of GDPPC 2012 by using moran.plot() of spdep.\n\nnci &lt;- moran.plot(hunan$GDPPC, rswm_q,\n                  labels=as.character(hunan$County), \n                  xlab=\"GDPPC 2012\", \n                  ylab=\"Spatially Lag GDPPC 2012\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the plot is split in 4 quadrants. The top right corner belongs to areas that have high GDPPC and are surrounded by other areas that have the average level of GDPPC. This are the high-high locations in the lesson slide.\n\n\n\nFirst we will use scale() to centers and scales the variable. Here centering is done by subtracting the mean (omitting NAs) the corresponding columns, and scaling is done by dividing the (centered) variable by their standard deviations.\n\nhunan$Z.GDPPC &lt;- scale(hunan$GDPPC) %&gt;% \n  as.vector \n\nThe as.vector() added to the end is to make sure that the data type we get out of this is a vector, that map neatly into out dataframe.\nNow, we are ready to plot the Moran scatterplot again by using the code chunk below.\n\nnci2 &lt;- moran.plot(hunan$Z.GDPPC, rswm_q,\n                   labels=as.character(hunan$County),\n                   xlab=\"z-GDPPC 2012\", \n                   ylab=\"Spatially Lag z-GDPPC 2012\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunks below show the steps to prepare a LISA cluster map\n\nquadrant &lt;- vector(mode=\"numeric\",length=nrow(localMI))\n\nNext, derives the spatially lagged variable of interest (i.e. GDPPC) and centers the spatially lagged variable around its mean.\n\nhunan$lag_GDPPC &lt;- lag.listw(rswm_q, hunan$GDPPC)\nDV &lt;- hunan$lag_GDPPC - mean(hunan$lag_GDPPC)     \n\nThis is follow by centering the local Moran’s around the mean.\n\nLM_I &lt;- localMI[,1] - mean(localMI[,1])    \n\nNext, we will set a statistical significance level for the local Moran.\n\nsignif &lt;- 0.05       \n\nThese four command lines define the low-low (1), low-high (2), high-low (3) and high-high (4) categories.\n\nquadrant[DV &lt;0 & LM_I&gt;0] &lt;- 1\nquadrant[DV &gt;0 & LM_I&lt;0] &lt;- 2\nquadrant[DV &lt;0 & LM_I&lt;0] &lt;- 3  \nquadrant[DV &gt;0 & LM_I&gt;0] &lt;- 4      \n\nLastly, places non-significant Moran in the category 0.\n\nquadrant[localMI[,5]&gt;signif] &lt;- 0\n\nIn fact, we can combined all the steps into one single code chunk as shown below:\n\nquadrant &lt;- vector(mode=\"numeric\",length=nrow(localMI))\nhunan$lag_GDPPC &lt;- lag.listw(rswm_q, hunan$GDPPC)\nDV &lt;- hunan$lag_GDPPC - mean(hunan$lag_GDPPC)     \nLM_I &lt;- localMI[,1]   \nsignif &lt;- 0.05       \nquadrant[DV &lt;0 & LM_I&gt;0] &lt;- 1\nquadrant[DV &gt;0 & LM_I&lt;0] &lt;- 2\nquadrant[DV &lt;0 & LM_I&lt;0] &lt;- 3  \nquadrant[DV &gt;0 & LM_I&gt;0] &lt;- 4    \nquadrant[localMI[,5]&gt;signif] &lt;- 0\n\n\n\n\nNow, we can build the LISA map by using the code chunks below.\n\nhunan.localMI$quadrant &lt;- quadrant\ncolors &lt;- c(\"#ffffff\", \"#2c7bb6\", \"#abd9e9\", \"#fdae61\", \"#d7191c\")\nclusters &lt;- c(\"insignificant\", \"low-low\", \"low-high\", \"high-low\", \"high-high\")\n\ntm_shape(hunan.localMI) +\n  tm_fill(col = \"quadrant\", \n          style = \"cat\", \n          palette = colors[c(sort(unique(quadrant)))+1], \n          labels = clusters[c(sort(unique(quadrant)))+1],\n          popup.vars = c(\"\")) +\n  tm_view(set.zoom.limits = c(11,17)) +\n  tm_borders(alpha=0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor effective interpretation, it is better to plot both the local Moran’s I values map and its corresponding p-values map next to each other.\nThe code chunk below will be used to create such visualisation.\n\ngdppc &lt;- qtm(hunan, \"GDPPC\")\n\nhunan.localMI$quadrant &lt;- quadrant\ncolors &lt;- c(\"#ffffff\", \"#2c7bb6\", \"#abd9e9\", \"#fdae61\", \"#d7191c\")\nclusters &lt;- c(\"insignificant\", \"low-low\", \"low-high\", \"high-low\", \"high-high\")\n\nLISAmap &lt;- tm_shape(hunan.localMI) +\n  tm_fill(col = \"quadrant\", \n          style = \"cat\", \n          palette = colors[c(sort(unique(quadrant)))+1], \n          labels = clusters[c(sort(unique(quadrant)))+1],\n          popup.vars = c(\"\")) +\n  tm_view(set.zoom.limits = c(11,17)) +\n  tm_borders(alpha=0.5)\n\ntmap_arrange(gdppc, LISAmap, \n             asp=1, ncol=2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can also include the local Moran’s I map and p-value map as shown below for easy comparison.\n\nlocalMI.map &lt;- tm_shape(hunan.localMI) +\n  tm_fill(col = \"Ii\", \n          style = \"pretty\", \n          title = \"local moran statistics\") +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)\n\npvalue.map &lt;- tm_shape(hunan.localMI) +\n  tm_fill(col = \"Pr.Ii\", \n          breaks=c(-Inf, 0.001, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, Inf),\n          palette=\"-Blues\", \n          title = \"local Moran's I p-values\") +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)\n\ntmap_arrange(localMI.map, pvalue.map, asp=1, ncol=2)\n\nVariable(s) \"Ii\" contains positive and negative values, so midpoint is set to 0. Set midpoint = NA to show the full spectrum of the color palette.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion: What statistical observations can you draw from the LISA map above?\n\nHigh-high clusters: There are several high-high clusters, indicating areas where the GDPPC is high and surrounded by other areas with high GDPPC. These clusters may suggest that certain factors, such as economic policies, infrastructure, or natural resources, are conducive to high economic growth in these regions.\n\n\n\nLow-low clusters: There are also some low-low clusters, indicating areas with low GDPPC that are surrounded by other areas with low GDPPC. These clusters may suggest that these regions face challenges such as lack of economic opportunities, infrastructure, or natural resources that hinder their economic development.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeside detecting cluster and outliers, localised spatial statistics can be also used to detect hot spot and/or cold spot areas.\nThe term ‘hot spot’ has been used generically across disciplines to describe a region or value that is higher relative to its surroundings (Lepers et al 2005, Aben et al 2012, Isobe et al 2015).\n\n\nAn alternative spatial statistics to detect spatial anomalies is the Getis and Ord’s G-statistics (Getis and Ord, 1972; Ord and Getis, 1995). It looks at neighbours within a defined proximity to identify where either high or low values clutser spatially. Here, statistically significant hot-spots are recognised as areas of high values where other areas within a neighbourhood range also share high values too.\nThe analysis consists of three steps:\n\nDeriving spatial weight matrix\nComputing Gi statistics\nMapping Gi statistics\n\n\n\n\nFirst, we need to define a new set of neighbours. Whist the spatial autocorrelation considered units which shared borders, for Getis-Ord we are defining neighbours based on distance.\nThere are two type of distance-based proximity matrix, they are:\n\nfixed distance weight matrix; and\nadaptive distance weight matrix.\n\n\n\nWe will need points to associate with each polygon before we can make our connectivity graph. It will be a little more complicated than just running st_centroid() on the sf object: us.bound. We need the coordinates in a separate data frame for this to work. To do this we will use a mapping function. The mapping function applies a given function to each element of a vector and returns a vector of the same length. Our input vector will be the geometry column of us.bound. Our function will be st_centroid(). We will be using map_dbl variation of map from the purrr package. For more documentation, check out map documentation\nTo get our longitude values we map the st_centroid() function over the geometry column of us.bound and access the longitude value through double bracket notation [[]] and 1. This allows us to get only the longitude, which is the first value in each centroid.\n\nlongitude &lt;- map_dbl(hunan$geometry, ~st_centroid(.x)[[1]])\n\nWe do the same for latitude with one key difference. We access the second value per each centroid with [[2]].\n\nlatitude &lt;- map_dbl(hunan$geometry, ~st_centroid(.x)[[2]])\n\nNow that we have latitude and longitude, we use cbind to put longitude and latitude into the same object.\n\ncoords &lt;- cbind(longitude, latitude)\n\n\n\n\nFirstly, we need to determine the upper limit for distance band by using the steps below:\n\nReturn a matrix with the indices of points belonging to the set of the k nearest neighbours of each other by using knearneigh() of spdep.\nConvert the knn object returned by knearneigh() into a neighbours list of class nb with a list of integer vectors containing neighbour region number ids by using knn2nb().\nReturn the length of neighbour relationship edges by using nbdists() of spdep. The function returns in the units of the coordinates if the coordinates are projected, in km otherwise.\nRemove the list structure of the returned object by using unlist().\n\n\n#coords &lt;- coordinates(hunan)\nk1 &lt;- knn2nb(knearneigh(coords))\n\nWarning in knn2nb(knearneigh(coords)): neighbour object has 25 sub-graphs\n\nk1dists &lt;- unlist(nbdists(k1, coords, longlat = TRUE))\nsummary(k1dists)\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.

Max. \n  24.79   32.57   38.01   39.07   44.52   61.79 \n\n\nThe summary report shows that the largest first nearest neighbour distance is 61.79 km, so using this as the upper threshold gives certainty that all units will have at least one neighbour.\n\n\n\nNow, we will compute the distance weight matrix by using dnearneigh() as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nwm_d62 &lt;- dnearneigh(coords, 0, 62, longlat = TRUE)\nwm_d62\n\nNeighbour list object:\nNumber of regions: 88 \nNumber of nonzero links: 324 \nPercentage nonzero weights: 4.183884 \nAverage number of links: 3.681818 \n\n\nNext, nb2listw() is used to convert the nb object into spatial weights object.\n\nwm62_lw &lt;- nb2listw(wm_d62, style = 'B')\nsummary(wm62_lw)\n\nCharacteristics of weights list object:\nNeighbour list object:\nNumber of regions: 88 \nNumber of nonzero links: 324 \nPercentage nonzero weights: 4.183884 \nAverage number of links: 3.681818 \nLink number distribution:\n\n 1  2  3  4  5  6 \n 6 15 14 26 20  7 \n6 least connected regions:\n6 15 30 32 56 65 with 1 link\n7 most connected regions:\n21 28 35 45 50 52 82 with 6 links\n\nWeights style: B \nWeights constants summary:\n   n   nn  S0  S1   S2\nB 88 7744 324 648 5440\n\n\nThe output spatial weights object is called wm62_lw.\n\n\n\n\nOne of the characteristics of fixed distance weight matrix is that more densely settled areas (usually the urban areas) tend to have more neighbours and the less densely settled areas (usually the rural counties) tend to have lesser neighbours. Having many neighbours smoothes the neighbour relationship across more neighbours.\nIt is possible to control the numbers of neighbours directly using k-nearest neighbours, either accepting asymmetric neighbours or imposing symmetry as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nknn &lt;- knn2nb(knearneigh(coords, k=8))\nknn\n\nNeighbour list object:\nNumber of regions: 88 \nNumber of nonzero links: 704

These areas are considered hotspots and may suggest that certain factors, such as economic policies, infrastructure, or natural resources, are conducive to high economic growth in these regions.\nColdspots: Areas with high negative Gi values indicate clusters of low GDPPC surrounded by other areas with low GDPPC. These areas are considered coldspots and may suggest that these regions face challenges such as lack of economic opportunities, infrastructure, or natural resources that hinder their economic development.\nSpatial outliers: Areas with low positive or negative Gi values indicate spatial outliers, where the GDPPC is significantly different from the surrounding areas.

In this sense, they are not summary statistics but scores that allow us to learn more about the spatial structure in our data. The general intuition behind the metrics however is similar to that of global ones. Some of them are even mathematically connected, where the global version can be decomposed into a collection of local ones. One such example are Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA). Beside LISA, Getis-Ord’s Gi-statistics will be introduce as an alternative LMSA statistics that present complementary information or allow us to obtain similar insights for geographically referenced data.\nIn this hands-on exercise, you will learn how to compute Local Measures of Spatial Autocorrelation (LMSA) by using spdep package. By the end to this hands-on exercise, you will be able to:\n\nimport geospatial data using appropriate function(s) of sf package,\nimport csv file using appropriate function of readr package,\nperform relational join using appropriate join function of dplyr package,\ncompute Local Indicator of Spatial Association (LISA) statistics for detecting clusters and outliers by using appropriate functions spdep package;\ncompute Getis-Ord’s Gi-statistics for detecting hot spot or/and cold spot area by using appropriate functions of spdep package; and\nto visualise the analysis output by using tmap package."

    "text": "Local Indicators of Spatial Association or LISA are statistics that evaluate the existence of clusters and/or outliers in the spatial arrangement of a given variable. For instance if we are studying distribution of GDP per capita of Hunan Provice, People Republic of China, local clusters in GDP per capita mean that there are counties that have higher or lower rates than is to be expected by chance alone; that is, the values occurring are above or below those of a random distribution in space.\nIn this section, you will learn how to apply appropriate Local Indicators for Spatial Association (LISA), especially local Moran’I to detect cluster and/or outlier from GDP per capita 2012 of Hunan Province, PRC.\n\n\nBefore we can compute the local spatial autocorrelation statistics, we need to construct a spatial weights of the study area. The spatial weights is used to define the neighbourhood relationships between the geographical units (i.e. county) in the study area.\nIn the code chunk below, poly2nb() of spdep package is used to compute contiguity weight matrices for the study area. This function builds a neighbours list based on regions with contiguous boundaries. If you look at the documentation you will see that you can pass a “queen” argument that takes TRUE or FALSE as options. If you do not specify this argument the default is set to TRUE, that is, if you don’t specify queen = FALSE this function will return a list of first order neighbours using the Queen criteria.\nMore specifically, the code chunk below is used to compute Queen contiguity weight matrix.\n\nwm_q &lt;- poly2nb(hunan, \n                queen=TRUE)\nsummary(wm_q)\n\nNeighbour list object:\nNumber of regions: 88 \nNumber of nonzero links: 448 \nPercentage nonzero weights: 5.785124 \nAverage number of links: 5.090909 \nLink number distribution:\n\n 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 11 \n 2  2 12 16 24 14 11  4  2  1 \n2 least connected regions:\n30 65 with 1 link\n1 most connected region:\n85 with 11 links\n\n\nThe summary report above shows that there are 88 area units in Hunan. The most connected area unit has 11 neighbours. There are two area units with only one neighbours.\n\n\n\nNext, we need to assign weights to each neighboring polygon. In our case, each neighboring polygon will be assigned equal weight (style=“W”). This is accomplished by assigning the fraction 1/(#ofneighbors) to each neighboring county then summing the weighted income values. While this is the most intuitive way to summaries the neighbors’ values it has one drawback in that polygons along the edges of the study area will base their lagged values on fewer polygons thus potentially over- or under-estimating the true nature of the spatial autocorrelation in the data. For this example, we’ll stick with the style=“W” option for simplicity’s sake but note that other more robust options are available, notably style=“B”.\n\nrswm_q &lt;- nb2listw(wm_q, \n                   style=\"W\", \n                   zero.policy = TRUE)\nrswm_q\n\nCharacteristics of weights list object:\nNeighbour list object:\nNumber of regions: 88 \nNumber of nonzero links: 448 \nPercentage nonzero weights: 5.785124 \nAverage number of links: 5.090909 \n\nWeights style: W \nWeights constants summary:\n   n   nn S0       S1       S2\nW 88 7744 88 37.86334 365.9147\n\n\nWhat can we learn from the code chunk above?\n\nThe input of nb2listw() must be an object of class nb. The syntax of the function has two major arguments, namely style and zero.poly.\nstyle can take values “W”, “B”, “C”, “U”, “minmax” and “S”. B is the basic binary coding, W is row standardised (sums over all links to n), C is globally standardised (sums over all links to n), U is equal to C divided by the number of neighbours (sums over all links to unity), while S is the variance-stabilizing coding scheme proposed by Tiefelsdorf et al. 1999, p. 167-168 (sums over all links to n).\nIf zero policy is set to TRUE, weights vectors of zero length are inserted for regions without neighbour in the neighbours list. These will in turn generate lag values of zero, equivalent to the sum of products of the zero row t(rep(0, length=length(neighbours))) %*% x, for arbitrary numerical vector x of length length(neighbours). The spatially lagged value of x for the zero-neighbour region will then be zero, which may (or may not) be a sensible choice.\n\n\n\n\nTo compute local Moran’s I, the localmoran() function of spdep will be used. It computes Ii values, given a set of zi values and a listw object providing neighbour weighting information for the polygon associated with the zi values.\nThe code chunks below are used to compute local Moran’s I of GDPPC2012 at the county level\n\nfips &lt;- order(hunan$County)\nlocalMI &lt;- localmoran(hunan$GDPPC, rswm_q)\nhead(localMI)\n\n            Ii          E.Ii       Var.Ii

    "text": "The LISA Cluster Map shows the significant locations color coded by type of spatial autocorrelation. The first step before we can generate the LISA cluster map is to plot the Moran scatterplot.\n\n\nThe Moran scatterplot is an illustration of the relationship between the values of the chosen attribute at each location and the average value of the same attribute at neighboring locations.\nThe code chunk below plots the Moran scatterplot of GDPPC 2012 by using moran.plot() of spdep.\n\nnci &lt;- moran.plot(hunan$GDPPC, rswm_q,\n                  labels=as.character(hunan$County), \n                  xlab=\"GDPPC 2012\", \n                  ylab=\"Spatially Lag GDPPC 2012\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the plot is split in 4 quadrants. The top right corner belongs to areas that have high GDPPC and are surrounded by other areas that have the average level of GDPPC. This are the high-high locations in the lesson slide.\n\n\n\nFirst we will use scale() to centers and scales the variable. Here centering is done by subtracting the mean (omitting NAs) the corresponding columns, and scaling is done by dividing the (centered) variable by their standard deviations.\n\nhunan$Z.GDPPC &lt;- scale(hunan$GDPPC) %&gt;% \n  as.vector \n\nThe as.vector() added to the end is to make sure that the data type we get out of this is a vector, that map neatly into out dataframe.\nNow, we are ready to plot the Moran scatterplot again by using the code chunk below.\n\nnci2 &lt;- moran.plot(hunan$Z.GDPPC, rswm_q,\n                   labels=as.character(hunan$County),\n                   xlab=\"z-GDPPC 2012\", \n                   ylab=\"Spatially Lag z-GDPPC 2012\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunks below show the steps to prepare a LISA cluster map\n\nquadrant &lt;- vector(mode=\"numeric\",length=nrow(localMI))\n\nNext, derives the spatially lagged variable of interest (i.e. GDPPC) and centers the spatially lagged variable around its mean.\n\nhunan$lag_GDPPC &lt;- lag.listw(rswm_q, hunan$GDPPC)\nDV &lt;- hunan$lag_GDPPC - mean(hunan$lag_GDPPC)     \n\nThis is follow by centering the local Moran’s around the mean.\n\nLM_I &lt;- localMI[,1] - mean(localMI[,1])    \n\nNext, we will set a statistical significance level for the local Moran.\n\nsignif &lt;- 0.05       \n\nThese four command lines define the low-low (1), low-high (2), high-low (3) and high-high (4) categories.\n\nquadrant[DV &lt;0 & LM_I&gt;0] &lt;- 1\nquadrant[DV &gt;0 & LM_I&lt;0] &lt;- 2\nquadrant[DV &lt;0 & LM_I&lt;0] &lt;- 3  \nquadrant[DV &gt;0 & LM_I&gt;0] &lt;- 4      \n\nLastly, places non-significant Moran in the category 0.\n\nquadrant[localMI[,5]&gt;signif] &lt;- 0\n\nIn fact, we can combined all the steps into one single code chunk as shown below:\n\nquadrant &lt;- vector(mode=\"numeric\",length=nrow(localMI))\nhunan$lag_GDPPC &lt;- lag.listw(rswm_q, hunan$GDPPC)\nDV &lt;- hunan$lag_GDPPC - mean(hunan$lag_GDPPC)     \nLM_I &lt;- localMI[,1]   \nsignif &lt;- 0.05       \nquadrant[DV &lt;0 & LM_I&gt;0] &lt;- 1\nquadrant[DV &gt;0 & LM_I&lt;0] &lt;- 2\nquadrant[DV &lt;0 & LM_I&lt;0] &lt;- 3  \nquadrant[DV &gt;0 & LM_I&gt;0] &lt;- 4    \nquadrant[localMI[,5]&gt;signif] &lt;- 0\n\n\n\n\nNow, we can build the LISA map by using the code chunks below.\n\nhunan.localMI$quadrant &lt;- quadrant\ncolors &lt;- c(\"#ffffff\", \"#2c7bb6\", \"#abd9e9\", \"#fdae61\", \"#d7191c\")\nclusters &lt;- c(\"insignificant\", \"low-low\", \"low-high\", \"high-low\", \"high-high\")\n\ntm_shape(hunan.localMI) +\n  tm_fill(col = \"quadrant\", \n          style = \"cat\", \n          palette = colors[c(sort(unique(quadrant)))+1], \n          labels = clusters[c(sort(unique(quadrant)))+1],\n          popup.vars = c(\"\")) +\n  tm_view(set.zoom.limits = c(11,17)) +\n  tm_borders(alpha=0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor effective interpretation, it is better to plot both the local Moran’s I values map and its corresponding p-values map next to each other.\nThe code chunk below will be used to create such visualisation.\n\ngdppc &lt;- qtm(hunan, \"GDPPC\")\n\nhunan.localMI$quadrant &lt;- quadrant\ncolors &lt;- c(\"#ffffff\", \"#2c7bb6\", \"#abd9e9\", \"#fdae61\", \"#d7191c\")\nclusters &lt;- c(\"insignificant\", \"low-low\", \"low-high\", \"high-low\", \"high-high\")\n\nLISAmap &lt;- tm_shape(hunan.localMI) +\n  tm_fill(col = \"quadrant\", \n          style = \"cat\", \n          palette = colors[c(sort(unique(quadrant)))+1], \n          labels = clusters[c(sort(unique(quadrant)))+1],\n          popup.vars = c(\"\")) +\n  tm_view(set.zoom.limits = c(11,17)) +\n  tm_borders(alpha=0.5)\n\ntmap_arrange(gdppc, LISAmap, \n             asp=1, ncol=2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can also include the local Moran’s I map and p-value map as shown below for easy comparison.\n\nlocalMI.map &lt;- tm_shape(hunan.localMI) +\n  tm_fill(col = \"Ii\", \n          style = \"pretty\", \n          title = \"local moran statistics\") +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)\n\npvalue.map &lt;- tm_shape(hunan.localMI) +\n  tm_fill(col = \"Pr.Ii\", \n          breaks=c(-Inf, 0.001, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, Inf),\n          palette=\"-Blues\", \n          title = \"local Moran's I p-values\") +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)\n\ntmap_arrange(localMI.map, pvalue.map, asp=1, ncol=2)\n\nVariable(s) \"Ii\" contains positive and negative values, so midpoint is set to 0. Set midpoint = NA to show the full spectrum of the color palette.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion: What statistical observations can you draw from the LISA map above?\n\nHigh-high clusters: There are several high-high clusters, indicating areas where the GDPPC is high and surrounded by other areas with high GDPPC. These clusters may suggest that certain factors, such as economic policies, infrastructure, or natural resources, are conducive to high economic growth in these regions.\n\n\n\nLow-low clusters: There are also some low-low clusters, indicating areas with low GDPPC that are surrounded by other areas with low GDPPC. These clusters may suggest that these regions face challenges such as lack of economic opportunities, infrastructure, or natural resources that hinder their economic development."

    "text": "Beside detecting cluster and outliers, localised spatial statistics can be also used to detect hot spot and/or cold spot areas.\nThe term ‘hot spot’ has been used generically across disciplines to describe a region or value that is higher relative to its surroundings (Lepers et al 2005, Aben et al 2012, Isobe et al 2015).\n\n\nAn alternative spatial statistics to detect spatial anomalies is the Getis and Ord’s G-statistics (Getis and Ord, 1972; Ord and Getis, 1995). It looks at neighbours within a defined proximity to identify where either high or low values clutser spatially. Here, statistically significant hot-spots are recognised as areas of high values where other areas within a neighbourhood range also share high values too.\nThe analysis consists of three steps:\n\nDeriving spatial weight matrix\nComputing Gi statistics\nMapping Gi statistics\n\n\n\n\nFirst, we need to define a new set of neighbours. Whist the spatial autocorrelation considered units which shared borders, for Getis-Ord we are defining neighbours based on distance.\nThere are two type of distance-based proximity matrix, they are:\n\nfixed distance weight matrix; and\nadaptive distance weight matrix.\n\n\n\nWe will need points to associate with each polygon before we can make our connectivity graph. It will be a little more complicated than just running st_centroid() on the sf object: us.bound. We need the coordinates in a separate data frame for this to work. To do this we will use a mapping function. The mapping function applies a given function to each element of a vector and returns a vector of the same length. Our input vector will be the geometry column of us.bound. Our function will be st_centroid(). We will be using map_dbl variation of map from the purrr package. For more documentation, check out map documentation\nTo get our longitude values we map the st_centroid() function over the geometry column of us.bound and access the longitude value through double bracket notation [[]] and 1. This allows us to get only the longitude, which is the first value in each centroid.\n\nlongitude &lt;- map_dbl(hunan$geometry, ~st_centroid(.x)[[1]])\n\nWe do the same for latitude with one key difference. We access the second value per each centroid with [[2]].\n\nlatitude &lt;- map_dbl(hunan$geometry, ~st_centroid(.x)[[2]])\n\nNow that we have latitude and longitude, we use cbind to put longitude and latitude into the same object.\n\ncoords &lt;- cbind(longitude, latitude)\n\n\n\n\nFirstly, we need to determine the upper limit for distance band by using the steps below:\n\nReturn a matrix with the indices of points belonging to the set of the k nearest neighbours of each other by using knearneigh() of spdep.\nConvert the knn object returned by knearneigh() into a neighbours list of class nb with a list of integer vectors containing neighbour region number ids by using knn2nb().\nReturn the length of neighbour relationship edges by using nbdists() of spdep. The function returns in the units of the coordinates if the coordinates are projected, in km otherwise.\nRemove the list structure of the returned object by using unlist().\n\n\n#coords &lt;- coordinates(hunan)\nk1 &lt;- knn2nb(knearneigh(coords))\n\nWarning in knn2nb(knearneigh(coords)): neighbour object has 25 sub-graphs\n\nk1dists &lt;- unlist(nbdists(k1, coords, longlat = TRUE))\nsummary(k1dists)\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.

Having many neighbours smoothes the neighbour relationship across more neighbours.\nIt is possible to control the numbers of neighbours directly using k-nearest neighbours, either accepting asymmetric neighbours or imposing symmetry as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nknn &lt;- knn2nb(knearneigh(coords, k=8))\nknn\n\nNeighbour list object:\nNumber of regions: 88 \nNumber of nonzero links: 704 \nPercentage nonzero weights: 9.090909 \nAverage number of links: 8 \nNon-symmetric neighbours list\n\n\nNext, nb2listw() is used to convert the nb object into spatial weights object.\n\nknn_lw &lt;- nb2listw(knn, style = 'B')\nsummary(knn_lw)\n\nCharacteristics of weights list object:\nNeighbour list object:\nNumber of regions: 88 \nNumber of nonzero links: 704 \nPercentage nonzero weights: 9.090909 \nAverage number of links: 8 \nNon-symmetric neighbours list\nLink number distribution:\n\n 8 \n88 \n88 least connected regions:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 with 8 links\n88 most connected regions:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 with 8 links\n\nWeights style: B \nWeights constants summary:\n   n   nn  S0   S1    S2\nB 88 7744 704 1300 23014"

FALSE, “call” set to the function call, and class “localG”.\nThe Gi statistics is represented as a Z-score. Greater values represent a greater intensity of clustering and the direction (positive or negative) indicates high or low clusters.\nNext, we will join the Gi values to their corresponding hunan sf data frame by using the code chunk below.\n\nhunan.gi &lt;- cbind(hunan, as.matrix(gi.fixed)) %&gt;%\n  rename(gstat_fixed = as.matrix.gi.fixed.)\n\nIn fact, the code chunk above performs three tasks. First, it convert the output vector (i.e. gi.fixed) into r matrix object by using as.matrix(). Next, cbind() is used to join hunan@data and gi.fixed matrix to produce a new SpatialPolygonDataFrame called hunan.gi. Lastly, the field name of the gi values is renamed to gstat_fixed by using rename().\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below shows the functions used to map the Gi values derived using fixed distance weight matrix.\n\ngdppc &lt;- qtm(hunan, \"GDPPC\")\n\nGimap &lt;-tm_shape(hunan.gi) +\n  tm_fill(col = \"gstat_fixed\", \n          style = \"pretty\",\n          palette=\"-RdBu\",\n          title = \"local Gi\") +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)\n\ntmap_arrange(gdppc, Gimap, asp=1, ncol=2)\n\nVariable(s) \"gstat_fixed\" contains positive and negative values, so midpoint is set to 0. Set midpoint = NA to show the full spectrum of the color palette.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion: What statistical observation can you draw from the Gi map above?\n\nHotspots: Areas with high positive Gi values indicate clusters of high GDPPC surrounded by other areas with high GDPPC. These areas are considered hotspots and may suggest that certain factors, such as economic policies, infrastructure, or natural resources, are conducive to high economic growth in these regions.\nColdspots: Areas with high negative Gi values indicate clusters of low GDPPC surrounded by other areas with low GDPPC. These areas are considered coldspots and may suggest that these regions face challenges such as lack of economic opportunities, infrastructure, or natural resources that hinder their economic development.\nSpatial outliers: Areas with low positive or negative Gi values indicate spatial outliers, where the GDPPC is significantly different from the surrounding areas. These outliers may suggest that factors such as trade, migration, or government policies are influencing the economic development of these regions.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below are used to compute the Gi values for GDPPC2012 by using an adaptive distance weight matrix (i.e knb_lw).\nThe code chunk below are used to compute the Gi values for GDPPC2012 by using an adaptive distance weight matrix (i.e knb_lw).\n\nfips &lt;- order(hunan$County)\ngi.adaptive &lt;- localG(hunan$GDPPC, knn_lw)\nhunan.gi &lt;- cbind(hunan, as.matrix(gi.adaptive)) %&gt;%\n  rename(gstat_adaptive = as.matrix.gi.adaptive.)\n\n\n\n\nIt is time for us to visualise the locations of hot spot and cold spot areas.

The print below reveals that it is in wgs84 coordinate system.\nGeometry set for 2290 features  Geometry type: POINT Dimension:     XYZ Bounding box:  xmin: 103.6878 ymin: 1.247759 xmax: 103.9897 ymax: 1.462134 z_range:       zmin: 0 zmax: 0 Geodetic CRS:  WGS 84 First 5 geometries:\nThis is a scenario that st_set_crs() is not appropriate and st_transform() of sf package should be used. This is because we need to reproject preschool from one coordinate system to another coordinate system mathemetically.\nLet us perform the projection transformation by using the code chunk below.\n\npreschool3414 &lt;- st_transform(preschool, \n                              crs = 3414)\n\n\nNote: In practice, we need find out the appropriate project coordinate system to use before performing the projection transformation.\n\nNext, let us display the content of preschool3414 sf data frame as shown below.\nGeometry set for 2290 features  Geometry type: POINT Dimension:     XYZ Bounding box:  xmin: 11810.03 ymin: 25596.33 xmax: 45404.24 ymax: 49300.88 z_range:       zmin: 0 zmax: 0 Projected CRS: SVY21 / Singapore TM First 5 geometries:\nNotice that it is in svy21 projected coordinate system now. Furthermore, if you refer to Bounding box:, the values are greater than 0-360 range of decimal degree commonly used by most of the geographic coordinate systems."

    "text": "1.8 Importing and Converting An Aspatial Data\nIn practice, it is not unusual that we will come across data such as listing of Inside Airbnb. We call this kind of data aspatial data. This is because it is not a geospatial data but among the data fields, there are two fields that capture the x- and y-coordinates of the data points.\nIn this section, you will learn how to import an aspatial data into R environment and save it as a tibble data frame. Next, you will convert it into a simple feature data frame.\nFor the purpose of this exercise, the listings.csv data downloaded from AirBnb will be used.\n\n1.8.1 Importing the aspatial data\nSince listings data set is in csv file format, we will use read_csv() of readr package to import listing.csv as shown the code chunk below. The output R object is called listings and it is a tibble data frame.\n\nlistings &lt;- read_csv(\"data/aspatial/listings.csv\")\n\nRows: 3540 Columns: 75\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr  (26): listing_url, source, name, description, neighborhood_overview, pi...\ndbl  (38): id, scrape_id, host_id, host_listings_count, host_total_listings_...\nlgl   (6): host_is_superhost, host_has_profile_pic, host_identity_verified, ...\ndate  (5): last_scraped, host_since, calendar_last_scraped, first_review, la...\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\nAfter importing the data file into R, it is important for us to examine if the data file has been imported correctly.\nThe code chunk below shows list() of Base R instead of glimpse() is used to do the job.\n\nlist(listings) \n\n[[1]]\n# A tibble: 3,540 × 75\n       id listing_url            scrape_id last_scraped source name  description\n    &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;                      &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;date&gt;       &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;      \n 1  71609 https://www.airbnb.co…   2.02e13 2024-06-29   previ… Ensu… For 3 room…\n 2  71896 https://www.airbnb.co…   2.02e13 2024-06-29   city … B&B … &lt;NA&gt;       \n 3  71903 https://www.airbnb.co…   2.02e13 2024-06-29   city … Room… Like your …\n 4 275343 https://www.airbnb.co…   2.02e13 2024-06-29   city … 10mi… **IMPORTAN…\n 5 275344 https://www.airbnb.co…   2.02e13 2024-06-29   city … 15 m… Lovely hom…\n 6 289234 https://www.airbnb.co…   2.02e13 2024-06-29   previ… Book… This whole…\n 7 294281 https://www.airbnb.co…   2.02e13 2024-06-29   city … 5 mi… I have 3 b…\n 8 324945 https://www.airbnb.co…   2.02e13 2024-06-29   city … Comf… **IMPORTAN…\n 9 330095 https://www.airbnb.co…   2.02e13 2024-06-29   city … Rela… **IMPORTAN…\n10 344803 https://www.airbnb.co…   2.02e13 2024-06-29   city … Budg… Direct bus…\n# ℹ 3,530 more rows\n# ℹ 68 more variables: neighborhood_overview &lt;chr&gt;, picture_url &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   host_id &lt;dbl&gt;, host_url &lt;chr&gt;, host_name &lt;chr&gt;, host_since &lt;date&gt;,\n#   host_location &lt;chr&gt;, host_about &lt;chr&gt;, host_response_time &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   host_response_rate &lt;chr&gt;, host_acceptance_rate &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   host_is_superhost &lt;lgl&gt;, host_thumbnail_url &lt;chr&gt;, host_picture_url &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   host_neighbourhood &lt;chr&gt;, host_listings_count &lt;dbl&gt;, …\n\n\nThe output reveals that listing tibble data frame consists of 4252 rows and 16 columns. Two useful fields we are going to use in the next phase are latitude and longitude. Note that they are in decimal degree format. As a best guess, we will assume that the data is in wgs84 Geographic Coordinate System.\n\n\n1.8.2 Creating a simple feature data frame from an aspatial data frame\nThe code chunk below converts listing data frame into a simple feature data frame by using st_as_sf() of sf packages\n\nlistings_sf &lt;- st_as_sf(listings, \n                       coords = c(\"longitude\", \"latitude\"),\n                       crs=4326) %&gt;%\n  st_transform(crs = 3414)\n\nThings to learn from the arguments above:\n\ncoords argument requires you to provide the column name of the x-coordinates first then followed by the column name of the y-coordinates.\ncrs argument requires you to provide the coordinates system in epsg format. EPSG: 4326 is wgs84 Geographic Coordinate System and EPSG: 3414 is Singapore SVY21 Projected Coordinate System.

To do so, they need to acquire 5 metres of reserved land on the both sides of the current cycling path. You are tasked to determine the extend of the land need to be acquired and their total area.\nThe solution:\nFirstly, st_buffer() of sf package is used to compute the 5-meter buffers around cycling paths\n\nbuffer_cycling &lt;- st_buffer(cyclingpath, \n                               dist=5, nQuadSegs = 30)\n\nThis is followed by calculating the area of the buffers as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nbuffer_cycling$AREA &lt;- st_area(buffer_cycling)\n\nLastly, sum() of Base R will be used to derive the total land involved\n\nsum(buffer_cycling$AREA)\n\n2218855 [m^2]\n\n\nMission Accomplished!\n\n\n1.9.2 Point-in-polygon count\nThe scenario:\nA pre-school service group want to find out the numbers of pre-schools in each Planning Subzone.\nThe solution:\nThe code chunk below performs two operations at one go. Firstly, identify pre-schools located inside each Planning Subzone by using st_intersects(). Next, length() of Base R is used to calculate numbers of pre-schools that fall inside each planning subzone.\n\nmpsz3414$`PreSch Count`&lt;- lengths(st_intersects(mpsz3414, preschool3414))\n\n\nWarning: You should not confuse with st_intersection().\n\nYou can check the summary statistics of the newly derived PreSch Count field by using summary() as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nsummary(mpsz3414$`PreSch Count`)\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.

You can override using the\n`.groups` argument.\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore we can perform the georelational join, one extra step is required to convert the values in PA and SZ fields to uppercase. This is because the values of PA and SZ fields are made up of upper- and lowercase. On the other, hand the SUBZONE_N and PLN_AREA_N are in uppercase.\n\npopdata2020 &lt;- popdata2020 %&gt;%\n  mutate_at(.vars = vars(PA, SZ), \n          .funs = list(toupper)) %&gt;%\n  filter(`ECONOMY ACTIVE` &gt; 0)\n\nNext, left_join() of dplyr is used to join the geographical data and attribute table using planning subzone name e.g. SUBZONE_N and SZ as the common identifier.\n\nmpsz_pop2020 &lt;- left_join(mpsz, popdata2020,\n                          by = c(\"SUBZONE_N\" = \"SZ\"))\n\nThing to learn from the code chunk above:\n\nleft_join() of dplyr package is used with mpsz simple feature data frame as the left data table is to ensure that the output will be a simple features data frame.\n\n\nwrite_rds(mpsz_pop2020, \"data/rds/mpszpop2020.rds\")"

    "text": "Choropleth mapping involves the symbolisation of enumeration units, such as countries, provinces, states, counties or census units, using area patterns or graduated colors. For example, a social scientist may need to use a choropleth map to portray the spatial distribution of aged population of Singapore by Master Plan 2014 Subzone Boundary.\nTwo approaches can be used to prepare thematic map using tmap, they are:\n\nPlotting a thematic map quickly by using qtm().\nPlotting highly customisable thematic map by using tmap elements.\n\n\n\nThe easiest and quickest to draw a choropleth map using tmap is using qtm(). It is concise and provides a good default visualisation in many cases.\nThe code chunk below will draw a cartographic standard choropleth map as shown below.\n\ntmap_mode(\"plot\")\n\ntmap mode set to plotting\n\nqtm(mpsz_pop2020, \n    fill = \"DEPENDENCY\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk above:\n\ntmap_mode() with “plot” option is used to produce a static map. For interactive mode, “view” option should be used.\nfill argument is used to map the attribute (i.e. DEPENDENCY)\n\n\n\n\nDespite its usefulness of drawing a choropleth map quickly and easily, the disadvantge of qtm() is that it makes aesthetics of individual layers harder to control. To draw a high quality cartographic choropleth map as shown in the figure below, tmap’s drawing elements should be used.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\", \n          style = \"quantile\", \n          palette = \"Blues\",\n          title = \"Dependency ratio\") +\n  tm_layout(main.title = \"Distribution of Dependency Ratio by planning subzone\",\n            main.title.position = \"center\",\n            main.title.size = 1.2,\n            legend.height = 0.45, \n            legend.width = 0.35,\n            frame = TRUE) +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +\n  tm_compass(type=\"8star\", size = 2) +\n  tm_scale_bar() +\n  tm_grid(alpha =0.2) +\n  tm_credits(\"Source: Planning Sub-zone boundary from Urban Redevelopment Authorithy (URA)\\n and Population data from Department of Statistics DOS\", \n             position = c(\"left\", \"bottom\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the following sub-section, we will share with you tmap functions that used to plot these elements.\n\n\nThe basic building block of tmap is tm_shape() followed by one or more layer elemments such as tm_fill() and tm_polygons().\nIn the code chunk below, tm_shape() is used to define the input data (i.e mpsz_pop2020) and tm_polygons() is used to draw the planning subzone polygons\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020) +\n  tm_polygons()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo draw a choropleth map showing the geographical distribution of a selected variable by planning subzone, we just need to assign the target variable such as Dependency to tm_polygons().\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_polygons(\"DEPENDENCY\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from tm_polygons():\n\nThe default interval binning used to draw the choropleth map is called “pretty”. A detailed discussion of the data classification methods supported by tmap will be provided in sub-section 4.3.\nThe default colour scheme used is YlOrRd of ColorBrewer. You will learn more about the color scheme in sub-section 4.4.\nBy default, Missing value will be shaded in grey.\n\n\n\n\nActually, tm_polygons() is a wraper of tm_fill() and tm_border(). tm_fill() shades the polygons by using the default colour scheme and tm_borders() adds the borders of the shapefile onto the choropleth map.\nThe code chunk below draws a choropleth map by using tm_fill() alone.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the planning subzones are shared according to the respective dependecy values\nTo add the boundary of the planning subzones, tm_borders will be used as shown in the code chunk below.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\") +\n  tm_borders(lwd = 0.1,  alpha = 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that light-gray border lines have been added on the choropleth map.\nThe alpha argument is used to define transparency number between 0 (totally transparent) and 1 (not transparent). By default, the alpha value of the col is used (normally 1).\nBeside alpha argument, there are three other arguments for tm_borders(), they are:\n\ncol = border colour,\nlwd = border line width. The default is 1, and\nlty = border line type. The default is “solid”.\n\n\n\n\n\nMost choropleth maps employ some methods of data classification. The point of classification is to take a large number of observations and group them into data ranges or classes.\ntmap provides a total ten data classification methods, namely: fixed, sd, equal, pretty (default), quantile, kmeans, hclust, bclust, fisher, and jenks.\nTo define a data classification method, the style argument of tm_fill() or tm_polygons() will be used.\n\n\nThe code chunk below shows a quantile data classification that used 5 classes.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\",\n          n = 5,\n          style = \"quantile\") +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, equal data classification method is used.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\",\n          n = 5,\n          style = \"equal\") +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the distribution of quantile data classification method are more evenly distributed then equal data classification method.\n\nWarning: Maps Lie!\n\n\nDIY: Using what you had learned, prepare choropleth maps by using different classification methods supported by tmap and compare their differences\n\n\n# Equal Interval Classification\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020) +\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\", n = 5, style = \"equal\") +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +\n  tm_layout(title = \"Equal Interval\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Quantile Classification\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020) +\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\", n = 5, style = \"quantile\") +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +\n  tm_layout(title = \"Quantile\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Jenks Natural Breaks Classification\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020) +\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\", n = 5, style = \"jenks\") +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +\n  tm_layout(title = \"Jenks Natural Breaks\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Fisher-Jenks Classification\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020) +\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\", n = 5, style = \"fisher\") +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +\n  tm_layout(title = \"Fisher-Jenks\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Standard Deviation Classification\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020) +\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\", n = 5, style = \"sd\") +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +\n  tm_layout(title = \"Standard Deviation\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEqual Interval: Simplifies the interpretation but can miss important data distributions.\nQuantile: Ensures balance in the number of observations per class but can obscure variation in the actual values.\nJenks/Fisher: Highlights clusters and natural breaks in the data but is more complex.\nStandard Deviation: Good for analyzing deviations from the mean, showing how values differ across the dataset.\n\nDIY: Preparing choropleth maps by using similar classification method but with different numbers of classes (i.e. 2, 6, 10, 20). Compare the output maps, what observation can you draw?\nWhen preparing choropleth maps with different numbers of classes (e.g., 2, 6, 10, 20), you are essentially altering the granularity of the information presented.\n\nTwo Classes:\n\nObservation: The map will be quite simplistic, likely resulting in large areas of the same color. This means that the map will not convey detailed variations within the data; instead, it will show broad categories. This might be useful for high-level overviews but lacks nuance.\n\nSix Classes:\n\nObservation: The map starts to show more distinctions between different areas. With six classes, you get a better sense of the variability in the data. This level of classification is often useful for intermediate analysis, where some detail is needed but not too much to overwhelm the viewer.\n\nTen Classes:\n\nObservation: The map will have even more detailed variations, allowing for finer distinctions between different regions. This can be useful for in-depth analysis and can help to reveal subtler patterns or anomalies in the data.\n\nTwenty Classes:\n\nObservation: The map will be very detailed, with many different shades or colors. While this provides the most detailed view, it can sometimes be overwhelming or difficult to interpret. It’s crucial to ensure that the map remains readable and that the distinctions between classes are meaningful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor all the built-in styles, the category breaks are computed internally. In order to override these defaults, the breakpoints can be set explicitly by means of the breaks argument to the tm_fill(). It is important to note that, in tmap the breaks include a minimum and maximum. As a result, in order to end up with n categories, n+1 elements must be specified in the breaks option (the values must be in increasing order).\nBefore we get started, it is always a good practice to get some descriptive statistics on the variable before setting the break points. Code chunk below will be used to compute and display the descriptive statistics of DEPENDENCY field.\n\nsummary(mpsz_pop2020$DEPENDENCY)\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max.    NA's \n 0.0000  0.5696  0.6154  0.6917  0.6950 19.0000      92 \n\n\nWith reference to the results above, we set break point at 0.60, 0.70, 0.80, and 0.90. In addition, we also need to include a minimum and maximum, which we set at 0 and 100. Our breaks vector is thus c(0, 0.60, 0.70, 0.80, 0.90, 1.00)\nNow, we will plot the choropleth map by using the code chunk below.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\",\n          breaks = c(0, 0.60, 0.70, 0.80, 0.90, 1.00)) +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)\n\nWarning: Values have found that are higher than the highest break\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.4.4 Colour Scheme\ntmap supports colour ramps either defined by the user or a set of predefined colour ramps from the RColorBrewer package.\n\n\n\nTo change the colour, we assign the preferred colour to palette argument of tm_fill() as shown in the code chunk below.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\",\n          n = 6,\n          style = \"quantile\",\n          palette = \"Blues\") +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the choropleth map is shaded in green.\nTo reverse the colour shading, add a “-” prefix.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\",\n          style = \"quantile\",\n          palette = \"-Greens\") +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the colour scheme has been reversed.\n\n\n\n\nMap layout refers to the combination of all map elements into a cohensive map. Map elements include among others the objects to be mapped, the title, the scale bar, the compass, margins and aspects ratios. Colour settings and data classification methods covered in the previous section relate to the palette and break-points are used to affect how the map looks.\n\n\nIn tmap, several legend options are provided to change the placement, format and appearance of the legend.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\", \n          style = \"jenks\", \n          palette = \"Blues\", \n          legend.hist = TRUE, \n          legend.is.portrait = TRUE,\n          legend.hist.z = 0.1) +\n  tm_layout(main.title = \"Distribution of Dependency Ratio by planning subzone \\n(Jenks classification)\",\n            main.title.position = \"center\",\n            main.title.size = 1,\n            legend.height = 0.45, \n            legend.width = 0.35,\n            legend.outside = FALSE,\n            legend.position = c(\"right\", \"bottom\"),\n            frame = FALSE) +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntmap allows a wide variety of layout settings to be changed. They can be called by using tmap_style().\nThe code chunk below shows the classic style is used.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\", \n          style = \"quantile\", \n          palette = \"-Greens\") +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +\n  tmap_style(\"classic\")\n\ntmap style set to \"classic\"\n\n\nother available styles are: \"white\", \"gray\", \"natural\", \"cobalt\", \"col_blind\", \"albatross\", \"beaver\", \"bw\", \"watercolor\" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeside map style, tmap also also provides arguments to draw other map furniture such as compass, scale bar and grid lines.\nIn the code chunk below, tm_compass(), tm_scale_bar() and tm_grid() are used to add compass, scale bar and grid lines onto the choropleth map.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\", \n          style = \"quantile\", \n          palette = \"Blues\",\n          title = \"No. of persons\") +\n  tm_layout(main.title = \"Distribution of Dependency Ratio \\nby planning subzone\",\n            main.title.position = \"center\",\n            main.title.size = 1.2,\n            legend.height = 0.45, \n            legend.width = 0.35,\n            frame = TRUE) +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +\n  tm_compass(type=\"8star\", size = 2) +\n  tm_scale_bar(width = 0.15) +\n  tm_grid(lwd = 0.1, alpha = 0.2) +\n  tm_credits(\"Source: Planning Sub-zone boundary from Urban Redevelopment Authorithy (URA)\\n and Population data from Department of Statistics DOS\", \n             position = c(\"left\", \"bottom\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo reset the default style, refer to the code chunk below.\n\ntmap_style(\"white\")\n\ntmap style set to \"white\"\n\n\nother available styles are: \"gray\", \"natural\", \"cobalt\", \"col_blind\", \"albatross\", \"beaver\", \"bw\", \"classic\", \"watercolor\" \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSmall multiple maps, also referred to as facet maps, are composed of many maps arrange side-by-side, and sometimes stacked vertically. Small multiple maps enable the visualisation of how spatial relationships change with respect to another variable, such as time.\nIn tmap, small multiple maps can be plotted in three ways:\n\nby assigning multiple values to at least one of the asthetic arguments,\nby defining a group-by variable in tm_facets(), and\nby creating multiple stand-alone maps with tmap_arrange().\n\n\n\nIn this example, small multiple choropleth maps are created by defining ncols in tm_fill()\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(c(\"YOUNG\", \"AGED\"),\n          style = \"equal\", \n          palette = \"Blues\") +\n  tm_layout(legend.position = c(\"right\", \"bottom\")) +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +\n  tmap_style(\"white\")\n\ntmap style set to \"white\"\n\n\nother available styles are: \"gray\", \"natural\", \"cobalt\", \"col_blind\", \"albatross\", \"beaver\", \"bw\", \"classic\", \"watercolor\" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this example, small multiple choropleth maps are created by assigning multiple values to at least one of the aesthetic arguments\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+ \n  tm_polygons(c(\"DEPENDENCY\",\"AGED\"),\n          style = c(\"equal\", \"quantile\"), \n          palette = list(\"Blues\",\"Greens\")) +\n  tm_layout(legend.position = c(\"right\", \"bottom\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this example, multiple small choropleth maps are created by using tm_facets().\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020) +\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\",\n          style = \"quantile\",\n          palette = \"Blues\",\n          thres.poly = 0) + \n  tm_facets(by=\"REGION_N\", \n            free.coords=TRUE, \n            drop.shapes=TRUE) +\n  tm_layout(legend.show = FALSE,\n            title.position = c(\"center\", \"center\"), \n            title.size = 20) +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)\n\nWarning: The argument drop.shapes has been renamed to drop.units, and is\ntherefore deprecated\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this example, multiple small choropleth maps are created by creating multiple stand-alone maps with tmap_arrange().\n\nyoungmap &lt;- tm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+ \n  tm_polygons(\"YOUNG\", \n              style = \"quantile\", \n              palette = \"Blues\")\n\nagedmap &lt;- tm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+ \n  tm_polygons(\"AGED\", \n              style = \"quantile\", \n              palette = \"Blues\")\n\ntmap_arrange(youngmap, agedmap, asp=1, ncol=2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstead of creating small multiple choropleth map, you can also use selection funtion to map spatial objects meeting the selection criterion.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020[mpsz_pop2020$REGION_N==\"CENTRAL REGION\", ])+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\", \n          style = \"quantile\", \n          palette = \"Blues\", \n          legend.hist = TRUE, \n          legend.is.portrait = TRUE,\n          legend.hist.z = 0.1) +\n  tm_layout(legend.outside = TRUE,\n            legend.height = 0.45, \n            legend.width = 5.0,\n            legend.position = c(\"right\", \"bottom\"),\n            frame = FALSE) +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)\n\nWarning in pre_process_gt(x, interactive = interactive, orig_crs =\ngm$shape.orig_crs): legend.width controls the width of the legend within a map.\nPlease use legend.outside.size to control the width of the outside legend"

They are:\n\nstd: univariately, subtract mean and divide by standard deviation.\nrobust: univariately, subtract median and divide by median absolute deviation.\nuniminmax: univariately, scale so the minimum of the variable is zero, and the maximum is one.\nglobalminmax: no scaling is done; the range of the graphs is defined by the global minimum and the global maximum.\ncenter: use uniminmax to standardize vertical height, then center each variable at a value specified by the scaleSummary param.\ncenterObs: use uniminmax to standardize vertical height, then center each variable at the value of the observation specified by the centerObsID param\n\nThere is no one best scaling method to use. You should explore them and select the one that best meet your analysis need.\nLast but not least, we can also compute the summary statistics such as mean, median, sd, etc to complement the visual interpretation.\nIn the code chunk below, group_by() and summarise() of dplyr are used to derive mean values of the clustering variables.\n\nshan_sf_ngeo_cluster %&gt;% \n  st_set_geometry(NULL) %&gt;%\n  group_by(CLUSTER) %&gt;%\n  summarise(mean_RADIO_PR = mean(RADIO_PR),\n            mean_TV_PR = mean(TV_PR),\n            mean_LLPHONE_PR = mean(LLPHONE_PR),\n            mean_MPHONE_PR = mean(MPHONE_PR),\n            mean_COMPUTER_PR = mean(COMPUTER_PR))\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 6\n  CLUSTER mean_RADIO_PR mean_TV_PR mean_LLPHONE_PR mean_MPHONE_PR\n  &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;           &lt;dbl&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 1               221.        521.            44.2           246.\n2 2               237.        402.            23.9           134.\n3 3               300.        611.            52.2           392.\n4 4               196.        744.            99.0           651.\n5 5               124.        224.            38.0           132.\n6 6                98.6       499.            74.5           468.\n# ℹ 1 more variable: mean_COMPUTER_PR &lt;dbl&gt;"

The data will enable geographic plotting and spatial analyses of provinces across Vietnam. The st_read function from the sf package is used here to load this shapefile, making it suitable for spatial analysis tasks such as mapping or integrating spatial features with aspatial data.\nPCI Data (PCI_2012_data to PCI_2022_data): These objects load Provincial Competitiveness Index (PCI) data for Vietnam for each year from 2012 to 2022. Each CSV file contains aspatial (non-geographic) data that likely includes indicators of economic performance, governance quality, business environment, and investment appeal at the provincial level. By reading the data for each year separately, it prepares for a time-series analysis of PCI metrics across provinces, allowing insights into trends or patterns in competitiveness and governance over time.\n\nThis setup aims to combine spatial and aspatial data for a comprehensive analysis of Vietnam’s provincial competitiveness over a decade.\n\n# Import administrative boundary data for vietnam\nboundary_data &lt;- st_read(dsn=\"data/geospatial\",\n                         layer = \"vnm_admbnda_adm1_gov_20201027\")\n\nReading layer `vnm_admbnda_adm1_gov_20201027' from data source \n  `C:\\edwing444\\IS415-GAA\\Take_Home_Ex\\Take_home_ex3\\data\\geospatial' \n  using driver `ESRI Shapefile'\nSimple feature collection with 63 features and 16 fields\nGeometry type: MULTIPOLYGON\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 102.144 ymin: 7.180931 xmax: 117.8355 ymax: 23.39221\nGeodetic CRS:  WGS 84\n\n\n\nPCI_2012_data &lt;- read.csv(\"data/aspatial/2012.csv\")\nPCI_2013_data &lt;- read.csv(\"data/aspatial/2013.csv\")\nPCI_2014_data &lt;- read.csv(\"data/aspatial/2014.csv\")\nPCI_2015_data &lt;- read.csv(\"data/aspatial/2015.csv\")\nPCI_2016_data &lt;- read.csv(\"data/aspatial/2016.csv\")\nPCI_2017_data &lt;- read.csv(\"data/aspatial/2017.csv\")\nPCI_2018_data &lt;- read.csv(\"data/aspatial/2018.csv\")\nPCI_2019_data &lt;- read.csv(\"data/aspatial/2019.csv\")\nPCI_2020_data &lt;- read.csv(\"data/aspatial/2020.csv\")\nPCI_2021_data &lt;- read.csv(\"data/aspatial/2021.csv\")\nPCI_2022_data &lt;- read.csv(\"data/aspatial/2022.csv\")\n\n\n\nCleaning data\nThis code refines the administrative boundary data by performing two main actions:\n\nSelecting and Dropping Columns: It removes several unnecessary columns from boundary_data, including administrative codes, alternative names, and validity dates, to keep only essential information. This reduces the dataset size and complexity, making it more manageable and focused on what is likely required for analysis.\nRenaming a Column: It renames the ADM1_EN column to province. This renaming enhances readability, making it clearer that this column represents the province name in English.\n\nOverall, these changes prepare the boundary_data for integration with other datasets (like the PCI data), focusing only on necessary columns for analysis.\n\nboundary_data &lt;- boundary_data %&gt;%\n  dplyr::select(-ADM1_VI,-ADM1_REF,-ADM1ALT1EN,-ADM1ALT2EN,-ADM1ALT1VI,-ADM1ALT2EN, -ADM1ALT2VI, -ADM0_VI,-ADM0_EN,-ADM0_PCODE,-date,-validOn,-validTo,-ADM1_PCODE) %&gt;% \n  rename(province = ADM1_EN)\n\nThese codes processes the PCI data for 2012-2022 by:\n\nDropping Unnecessary Columns: It removes various unnamed columns (X, X.1, X.2, etc.) and the No column, which may contain indices or irrelevant data. These columns might have been automatically generated during data export or are not needed for analysis.\nRenaming the Province Column: The column Province is renamed to province to match the column name in boundary_data. Consistently naming this key column across datasets enables smoother data merging or joining, especially when linking the PCI data with the spatial boundary data.\n\nThis preparation step ensures the PCI data is streamlined and ready for integration with other datasets in the analysis.\n\n201220132014201520162017\n\n\n\nPCI_2012_data &lt;- PCI_2012_data %&gt;%\n  dplyr::select(-X,-X.1,-X.2,-X.3,-X.4,-X.5, -X.6, -X.7,-X.8,-X.9,-X.10,-No) %&gt;% \n  rename(province = Province)\n\n\n\n\nPCI_2013_data &lt;- PCI_2013_data %&gt;%\n  dplyr::select(-X,-X.1,-X.2,-X.3,-X.4,-X.5, -X.6, -X.7,-X.8,-X.9,-PCI.2013.ranking,-No) %&gt;% \n  rename(province = Province)\n\n\n\n\nPCI_2014_data &lt;- PCI_2014_data %&gt;%\n  dplyr::select(-X,-X.1,-X.2,-X.3,-X.4,-X.5, -X.6, -X.7,-X.8,-X.9,-PCI.2014.ranking,-No) %&gt;% \n  rename(province = Province)\n\n\n\n\nPCI_2015_data &lt;- PCI_2015_data %&gt;%\n  dplyr::select(-X,-X.1,-X.2,-X.3,-X.4,-X.5, -X.6, -X.7,-X.8,-X.9,-PCI.2015.ranking,-No) %&gt;% \n  rename(province = Province)\n\n\n\n\nPCI_2016_data &lt;- PCI_2016_data %&gt;%\n  dplyr::select(-X,-X.1,-X.2,-X.3,-X.4,-X.5, -X.6, -X.7,-X.8,-X.9,-X.10,-X.11,-PCI.2016.ranking,-No) %&gt;% \n  rename(province = Province)\n\n\n\n\nPCI_2017_data &lt;- PCI_2017_data %&gt;%\n  dplyr::select(-Rank) %&gt;% \n  rename(province = Province)\n\n\n\n\n\n20182019202020212022\n\n\n\nPCI_2018_data &lt;- PCI_2018_data %&gt;%\n  dplyr::select(-Rank) %&gt;% \n  rename(province = Province)\n\n\n\n\nPCI_2019_data &lt;- PCI_2019_data %&gt;%\n  dplyr::select(-Rank) %&gt;% \n  rename(province = Province)\n\n\n\n\nPCI_2020_data &lt;- PCI_2020_data %&gt;%\n  rename(province = Province)\n\n\n\n\nPCI_2021_data &lt;- PCI_2021_data %&gt;%\n  rename(province = Province)\n\n\n\n\nPCI_2022_data &lt;- PCI_2022_data %&gt;%\n  rename(province = Province)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoining data\nThis code joins the spatial boundary data and PCI data for 2012-2022 by:\n\nMerging Data: The left_join function merges boundary_data with PCI data using the province column as a common key. This results in a new PCI dataset that includes spatial information (geometry) from boundary_data along with the PCI indicators for 2012-2022. The left_join ensures that all records from boundary_data are kept, and matching rows from PCI data are added.\nRemoving Rows with Missing Data: drop_na removes any rows with NA values from PCI data, likely to ensure that only provinces with complete PCI data and spatial information are retained for further analysis. This prevents issues that could arise from missing values during analysis or visualization.\n\nThis approach creates a complete dataset with both spatial and PCI data for 2012-2022, facilitating spatial analysis and mapping of competitiveness indicators across Vietnamese provinces.\n\n201220132014201520162017\n\n\n\nPCI_2012_data &lt;- boundary_data %&gt;%\n  left_join(PCI_2012_data, by = \"province\")\n\nPCI_2012_data &lt;- drop_na(PCI_2012_data)\n\n\n\n\nPCI_2013_data &lt;- boundary_data %&gt;%\n  left_join(PCI_2013_data, by = \"province\")\n\nPCI_2013_data &lt;- drop_na(PCI_2013_data)\n\n\n\n\nPCI_2014_data &lt;- boundary_data %&gt;%\n  left_join(PCI_2014_data, by = \"province\")\n\nPCI_2014_data &lt;- drop_na(PCI_2014_data)\n\n\n\n\nPCI_2015_data &lt;- boundary_data %&gt;%\n  left_join(PCI_2015_data, by = \"province\")\n\nPCI_2015_data &lt;- drop_na(PCI_2015_data)\n\n\n\n\nPCI_2016_data &lt;- boundary_data %&gt;%\n  left_join(PCI_2016_data, by = \"province\")\n\nPCI_2016_data &lt;- drop_na(PCI_2016_data)\n\n\n\n\nPCI_2017_data &lt;- boundary_data %&gt;%\n  left_join(PCI_2017_data, by = \"province\")\n\nPCI_2017_data &lt;- drop_na(PCI_2017_data)\n\n\n\n\n\n20182019202020212022\n\n\n\nPCI_2018_data &lt;- boundary_data %&gt;%\n  left_join(PCI_2018_data, by = \"province\")\n\nPCI_2018_data &lt;- drop_na(PCI_2018_data)\n\n\n\n\nPCI_2019_data &lt;- boundary_data %&gt;%\n  left_join(PCI_2019_data, by = \"province\")\n\nPCI_2019_data &lt;- drop_na(PCI_2019_data)\n\n\n\n\nPCI_2020_data &lt;- boundary_data %&gt;%\n  left_join(PCI_2020_data, by = \"province\")\n\nPCI_2020_data &lt;- drop_na(PCI_2020_data)\n\n\n\n\nPCI_2021_data &lt;- boundary_data %&gt;%\n  left_join(PCI_2021_data, by = \"province\")\n\nPCI_2021_data &lt;- drop_na(PCI_2021_data)\n\n\n\n\nPCI_2022_data &lt;- boundary_data %&gt;%\n  left_join(PCI_2022_data, by = \"province\")\n\nPCI_2022_data &lt;- drop_na(PCI_2022_data)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreparing and Computing Data for Global Moran I\nThis code prepares a spatial weights matrix using Queen contiguity to model spatial relationships between provinces in the PCI dataset:\n\nCalculate Centroids: st_centroid(st_geometry(PCI_2012_data)) computes the centroids of each province’s polygon. While centroids aren’t directly needed for creating a contiguity matrix, they can be useful for visualizations or other analyses.\nCreate Neighbor List Using Queen Contiguity: poly2nb(PCI_2012_data, queen = TRUE) establishes a neighbors list where provinces sharing a border are considered neighbors (Queen contiguity). This approach is inclusive, considering any shared edge or corner between polygons as a connection.\nConvert to Spatial Weights List: nb2listw(nb_global_2012, style = \"W\") transforms the neighbors list (nb_global_2012) into a spatial weights matrix (lw_global_2012). The style = \"W\" parameter row-standardizes the weights, meaning each row sums to 1, providing relative influence among neighbors and helping avoid scale issues in spatial analysis.\n\nThis setup is crucial for spatial econometric models and for analyzing spatial autocorrelation, as it defines how each province relates to its neighbors.\n\n201220132014201520162017\n\n\n\n# Step 1: Create spatial weights matrix (Queen Contiguity)\ncoords_global_2012 &lt;- st_centroid(st_geometry(PCI_2012_data)) # Use centroids of polygons\nnb_global_2012 &lt;- poly2nb(PCI_2012_data, queen = TRUE) # Create neighbors list using queen contiguity\nlw_global_2012 &lt;- nb2listw(nb_global_2012, style = \"W\") # Convert to weights list (row-standardized)\n\n\n#covert to numeric for PCI 2012\nPCI_2012_data$PCI.2012 &lt;- as.numeric(PCI_2012_data$PCI.2012)\n# Step 2: Compute Global Moran's I\nglobal_moran_2012 &lt;- moran.test(PCI_2012_data$PCI.2012, lw_global_2012)\n# Step 3: Print the results\nprint(global_moran_2012)\n\n\n    Moran I test under randomisation\n\ndata:  PCI_2012_data$PCI.2012  \nweights: lw_global_2012    \n\nMoran I statistic standard deviate = 1.0588, p-value = 0.1448\nalternative hypothesis: greater\nsample estimates:\nMoran I statistic       Expectation          Variance \n      0.080655874      -0.017543860       0.008601753 \n\n\n\nMoran’s I statistic: The Moran’s I statistic is 0.0807, a positive value indicating weak positive spatial autocorrelation.

This suggests a slight presence of spatial clustering, though not substantial.\np-value: The p-value is 0.1448, which is higher than the conventional significance level of 0.05, meaning that the result is not statistically significant.\n\n\nConclusion:\nThe Moran’s I test for 2012 indicates weak positive spatial autocorrelation, but with a p-value of 0.1448, the result is not statistically significant. This suggests that there is insufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis of no spatial autocorrelation.

The spatial clustering observed in 2022 is stronger and more significant than in previous years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreparing Data for LISA of PCI\nThese codse enhances the PCI 2012-2022 dataset by adding spatial contiguity and weight information as new columns:\n\nCalculate Neighbor List: st_contiguity(geometry) identifies neighboring provinces for each province based on contiguity, and the result is stored in the new column nb. This function creates a list where each province has a record of which other provinces are contiguous to it.\nAssign Weights to Neighbors: st_weights(nb, style=\"W\") calculates a row-standardized weight for each neighbor in nb, stored in the new column wt. The style=\"W\" parameter means that the weights for each province’s neighbors will sum to 1. This type of weight structure is useful for spatial analysis, as it standardizes the influence each neighboring province has on the focal province.\nPlace Columns at the Beginning: The .before = 1 argument ensures that the new columns (nb and wt) are positioned at the beginning of the dataset, making them easy to access and review during analysis.\n\nThis setup embeds spatial structure directly into the PCI dataset, preparing it for further spatial econometric analysis by linking each province with its neighbors and assigning standardized weights.\nThe 2nd code performs Local Moran’s I analysis on the PCI data for 2012-2022 to identify spatial autocorrelation at the provincial level:\n\nCalculate Local Moran’s I: local_moran(PCI.2012, nb, wt, nsim=99) computes Local Moran’s I statistic for the PCI.2012 variable, which represents the Provincial Competitiveness Index for each province. This function assesses the degree of spatial autocorrelation locally, identifying clusters and outliers of high or low PCI values relative to neighboring provinces:\n\nnb: The neighbors list (spatial contiguity) column created earlier.\nwt: The spatial weights column.\nnsim=99: Sets the number of simulations to 99, used for significance testing to evaluate if the observed spatial patterns are statistically significant.\n\nStore Results in local_moran Column: This result is saved as a new column local_moran. The .before=1 argument ensures that local_moran is placed at the start of the data frame for easy access.\nUnnest the Results: unnest(local_moran) expands the local_moran column if it contains nested data (e.g., lists of statistics for each province), spreading them into separate columns. This makes the Local Moran’s I values for each province more accessible for further analysis or visualization.\n\nThe resulting lisa_2012 dataset provides Local Moran’s I values for each province, allowing me to map spatial clusters and test for the presence of spatially structured patterns in PCI values across Vietnam. And I repeat the above steps for the remaining years\n\n201220132014201520162017\n\n\n\nwm_q_2012 &lt;- PCI_2012_data %&gt;% \n  mutate(nb=st_contiguity(geometry),\n         wt=st_weights(nb,\n                       style=\"W\"),\n         .before = 1)\n\n\nlisa_2012 &lt;- wm_q_2012 %&gt;% \n  mutate(local_moran = local_moran(\n    PCI.2012,nb,wt,nsim=99),\n    .before=1) %&gt;% \n  unnest(local_moran)\n\n\n\n\nwm_q_2013 &lt;- PCI_2013_data %&gt;% \n  mutate(nb=st_contiguity(geometry),\n         wt=st_weights(nb,\n                       style=\"W\"),\n         .before = 1)\n\n\nlisa_2013 &lt;- wm_q_2013 %&gt;% \n  mutate(local_moran = local_moran(\n    PCI.2013,nb,wt,nsim=99),\n    .before=1) %&gt;% \n  unnest(local_moran)\n\n\n\n\nwm_q_2014 &lt;- PCI_2014_data %&gt;% \n  mutate(nb=st_contiguity(geometry),\n         wt=st_weights(nb,\n                       style=\"W\"),\n         .before = 1)\n\n\nlisa_2014 &lt;- wm_q_2014 %&gt;% \n  mutate(local_moran = local_moran(\n    PCI.2014,nb,wt,nsim=99),\n    .before=1) %&gt;% \n  unnest(local_moran)\n\n\n\n\nwm_q_2015 &lt;- PCI_2015_data %&gt;% \n  mutate(nb=st_contiguity(geometry),\n         wt=st_weights(nb,\n                       style=\"W\"),\n         .before = 1)\n\n\nlisa_2015 &lt;- wm_q_2015 %&gt;% \n  mutate(local_moran = local_moran(\n    PCI.2015,nb,wt,nsim=99),\n    .before=1) %&gt;% \n  unnest(local_moran)\n\n\n\n\nwm_q_2016 &lt;- PCI_2016_data %&gt;% \n  mutate(nb=st_contiguity(geometry),\n         wt=st_weights(nb,\n                       style=\"W\"),\n         .before = 1)\n\n\nlisa_2016 &lt;- wm_q_2016 %&gt;% \n  mutate(local_moran = local_moran(\n    PCI.2016,nb,wt,nsim=99),\n    .before=1) %&gt;% \n  unnest(local_moran)\n\n\n\n\nwm_q_2017 &lt;- PCI_2017_data %&gt;% \n  mutate(nb=st_contiguity(geometry),\n         wt=st_weights(nb,\n                       style=\"W\"),\n         .before = 1)\n\n\nlisa_2017 &lt;- wm_q_2017 %&gt;% \n  mutate(local_moran = local_moran(\n    The.Weighted.PCI.Score.in.2017,nb,wt,nsim=99),\n    .before=1) %&gt;% \n  unnest(local_moran)\n\n\n\n\n\n20182019202020212022\n\n\n\nwm_q_2018 &lt;- PCI_2018_data %&gt;% \n  mutate(nb=st_contiguity(geometry),\n         wt=st_weights(nb,\n                       style=\"W\"),\n         .before = 1)\n\n\nlisa_2018 &lt;- wm_q_2018 %&gt;% \n  mutate(local_moran = local_moran(\n    The.Weighted.PCI.Score.in.2018,nb,wt,nsim=99),\n    .before=1) %&gt;% \n  unnest(local_moran)\n\n\n\n\nwm_q_2019 &lt;- PCI_2019_data %&gt;% \n  mutate(nb=st_contiguity(geometry),\n         wt=st_weights(nb,\n                       style=\"W\"),\n         .before = 1)\n\n\nlisa_2019 &lt;- wm_q_2019 %&gt;% \n  mutate(local_moran = local_moran(\n    The.Weighted.PCI.Score,nb,wt,nsim=99),\n    .before=1) %&gt;% \n  unnest(local_moran)\n\n\n\n\nwm_q_2020 &lt;- PCI_2020_data %&gt;% \n  mutate(nb=st_contiguity(geometry),\n         wt=st_weights(nb,\n                       style=\"W\"),\n         .before = 1)\n\n\nlisa_2020 &lt;- wm_q_2020 %&gt;% \n  mutate(local_moran = local_moran(\n    The.Weighted.PCI.Score,nb,wt,nsim=99),\n    .before=1) %&gt;% \n  unnest(local_moran)\n\n\n\n\nwm_q_2021 &lt;- PCI_2021_data %&gt;% \n  mutate(nb=st_contiguity(geometry),\n         wt=st_weights(nb,\n                       style=\"W\"),\n         .before = 1)\n\n\nlisa_2021 &lt;- wm_q_2021 %&gt;% \n  mutate(local_moran = local_moran(\n    The.Weighted.PCI.Score,nb,wt,nsim=99),\n    .before=1) %&gt;% \n  unnest(local_moran)\n\n\n\n\nwm_q_2022 &lt;- PCI_2022_data %&gt;% \n  mutate(nb=st_contiguity(geometry),\n         wt=st_weights(nb,\n                       style=\"W\"),\n         .before = 1)\n\n\nlisa_2022 &lt;- wm_q_2022 %&gt;% \n  mutate(local_moran = local_moran(\n    The.Weighted.PCI.Score,nb,wt,nsim=99),\n    .before=1) %&gt;% \n  unnest(local_moran)\n\n\n\n\nBelow is LISA sdep method\n\n# Create a spatial weights matrix\ncoords &lt;- st_coordinates(st_centroid(PCI_2022_data))\n\nWarning: st_centroid assumes attributes are constant over geometries\n\nnb &lt;- knn2nb(knearneigh(coords, k = 4)) # K-nearest neighbors\n\nWarning in knearneigh(coords, k = 4): knearneigh: identical points found\n\n\nWarning in knearneigh(coords, k = 4): knearneigh: kd_tree not available for\nidentical points\n\nlw &lt;- nb2listw(nb, style = \"W\")\n\n\n# Calculate local Moran's I for each region\nlocal_moran_2022 &lt;- localmoran(PCI_2022_data$The.Weighted.PCI.Score, lw)\n\n# Add the results to the data for visualization\nPCI_2022_data$local_moran_2022 &lt;- as.numeric(local_moran_2022[, \"Ii\"])\n\n\n\nVisualising LISA of PCI\nThis code filters the Local Moran’s I analysis results to keep only the provinces with statistically significant spatial autocorrelation at the 5% level:\n\nFilter Significant Results: filter(p_ii &lt; 0.05) selects only rows where p_ii, the p-value for the Local Moran’s I statistic, is less than 0.05. This threshold indicates a statistically significant result, meaning that the observed clustering or dispersion in PCI values is unlikely due to random chance (with a confidence level of 95%).\nCreate lisa_sig_2012 Dataset: The filtered dataset lisa_sig_2012 now contains only those provinces with significant Local Moran’s I values, indicating significant clusters or spatial outliers of the PCI in 2012.\n\nThis refined dataset enables focused analysis or visualization of areas with meaningful spatial patterns in competitiveness, highlighting where PCI scores are spatially clustered or anomalous. And I repeat again for the remaining years\n\nReasons for Using the 5% Threshold\n\nStandard in Statistical Testing: The 5% threshold has become a conventional standard across many fields, balancing rigor with a manageable likelihood of Type I error (incorrectly rejecting a true null hypothesis).\nInterpretability: Results significant at the 5% level suggest a 95% confidence that there is a non-random spatial pattern, making findings more reliable and interpretable.\nTrade-Off: Lowering the threshold (e.g., 1%) increases confidence but might miss some true effects, while a higher threshold (e.g., 10%) increases sensitivity but could result in more false positives. The 5% level strikes a balance between these.\n\nUsing this threshold in your Local Moran’s I analysis ensures that significant spatial patterns are both reliable and meaningful.\n\n201220132014201520162017\n\n\n\nlisa_sig_2012 &lt;- lisa_2012 %&gt;% \n  filter(p_ii &lt; 0.05)\n\n\n tm_shape(lisa_2012)+\n  tm_fill('ii')+\n  tm_borders(alpha=0.5)+\n  tm_view(set.zoom.limits = c(5,8))+\n  tm_layout(\n    main.title = \"LISA Cluster Map: PCI\",\n    main.title.size = 2\n  )\n\nVariable(s) \"ii\" contains positive and negative values, so midpoint is set to 0.

Here’s a structured approach for observations and conclusions when analyzing multi-year LISA cluster maps:\n\n\nObservations (Trends Over Time):\n\nConsistency in Spatial Clustering:\n\nPersistent Clusters: Identify if there are regions where high or low PCI clusters have remained stable over the years. This would indicate areas with long-standing socioeconomic or environmental characteristics.\nShifting Clusters: Observe if clusters have shifted geographically. For instance, regions that were high-PCI in 2012 but have declined by 2022, or vice versa, might reflect economic development or degradation in certain areas.\n\nEmergence of New Clusters:\n\nIf new clusters (either high or low) appear in certain regions over the years, it could suggest changes in local conditions, such as new infrastructure projects, changes in industrial activity, or environmental policies impacting PCI.\nCentral and Peripheral Changes: Note if certain central regions have consistently high PCI clusters compared to more peripheral regions that may struggle with low PCI clusters. This could hint at centralized development.\n\nMagnitude of PCI Values:\n\nIncreasing High-PCI Clusters: A gradual increase in green shades (0.5 to 1.5) could indicate economic growth or improvements in living standards in certain areas.\nExpanding Low-PCI Clusters: An increase in red or orange clusters (-1.0 to -1.5) over time might indicate growing socioeconomic challenges or environmental issues in specific regions.\n\nRegional Policy Impact:\n\nCompare LISA maps pre- and post-specific policy interventions. For example, if a new economic development program was launched in a particular region around 2015, check for positive PCI clustering trends after that year. Similarly, if certain regions faced challenges like natural disasters, this could be reflected in their spatial patterns.\n\nInter-Regional Comparisons:\n\nOver time, you may see certain regions improving faster than others. This could highlight disparities in regional development and might suggest the need for targeted support in lagging areas.\n\n\n\n\nConclusion:\n\nIdentify Consistent and Changing Patterns:\n\nConclude by highlighting regions with stable high or low PCI clusters, which suggest persistent conditions. For instance, if a particular province consistently shows high PCI values, it may be economically robust and potentially a model for other areas. Regions with stable low PCI clusters may need sustained assistance or new policy initiatives.\n\nAnalyze Temporal Changes:\n\nRecognize any significant shifts over the decade. For example, if northern Vietnam shows a gradual increase in PCI clusters, it may indicate that targeted development policies have been successful there. Conversely, areas with worsening PCI over time may require reevaluation of local policies.\n\nPolicy Implications:\n\nSuggest that policymakers focus on emerging low-PCI clusters or regions with persistent low values. The analysis can guide resource allocation, with higher investments in regions where PCI has not improved significantly over the years.\nFor regions showing improvement, policymakers can investigate successful practices and potentially replicate these strategies in struggling areas.\n\n\nBelow is my lisa cluster using sdep method\n\n# Create the LISA cluster map\ntm_shape(PCI_2022_data) +\n  tm_polygons(\"local_moran_2022\", \n              title = \"Local Moran's I (PCI Clusters)\", \n              palette = \"RdBu\", \n              style = \"cont\") + \n  tm_layout(main.title = \"LISA Cluster Map: PCI\", \n            legend.outside = TRUE)\n\nVariable(s) \"local_moran_2022\" contains positive and negative values, so midpoint is set to 0.

These are regions where low PCI scores cluster, indicating they are less attractive for business or have poor economic governance.\nA few provinces in central Vietnam fall into this category, suggesting these areas might face challenges such as bureaucracy, underdeveloped infrastructure, or less favorable conditions for economic growth.\n\nIntermediate Areas (Yellow to Orange):\n\nProvinces in yellow to orange have moderate PCI values, indicating no significant clustering of competitiveness. These areas are neither clear hotspots nor cold spots but fall somewhere in the middle in terms of their competitive standing.\n\n\nSignificant Regional Trends:\n\nNorthern Vietnam:\n\nThe northern provinces are a clear hotspot for competitiveness, particularly around the capital region of Hanoi. This likely reflects the concentration of government institutions, better infrastructure, and higher foreign direct investment (FDI) in the region.\n\nCentral Vietnam:\n\nThe central regions of Vietnam are somewhat mixed, with both cold spots and hotspots present. Certain areas are performing well, while others lag in terms of competitiveness.\n\nSouthern Vietnam:\n\nA few provinces in the southern part of Vietnam, particularly around the Mekong Delta and near Ho Chi Minh City, are moderately competitive but don’t form strong clusters of high or low competitiveness.\n\n\nInsights for Policy and Business:\n\nHotspot Areas (Red) should be regarded as prime locations for further investment and expansion, given their strong competitive environment.\nCold Spot Areas (Dark) may require policy interventions, such as improvements in governance, infrastructure, or business regulations to enhance competitiveness.\nYellow to Orange Areas may be transitioning or developing regions where businesses might experience mixed results depending on local factors.\n\n\n\nConclusion:\nThis map is a useful tool for understanding the spatial patterns of competitiveness in Vietnam’s provinces. The identified hotspots in the north and central parts of the country represent regions where businesses are thriving, and the business environment is supportive of economic growth. Meanwhile, the cold spots point to provinces that may be struggling and in need of policy reforms or infrastructure investments to boost their competitiveness. This type of analysis can inform government initiatives, business decisions, and investments by highlighting where competitive advantages or disadvantages are geographically concentrated.\n\n\n\nPreparing data for LISA of industrial production\n\nInd Prod Data : These objects load Industrial Production data for Vietnam for each year from 2012 to 2022. Each CSV file contains aspatial (non-geographic) data that includes indicators of industrial production at the provincial level. By reading the data for each year separately, it prepares for a time-series analysis of industrial production metrics across provinces, allowing insights into trends or patterns in competitiveness and governance over time.\n\n\nind_prod &lt;- read.csv('data/aspatial/industrial_prod.csv')\n\n\nJoining data\nThis code joins the spatial boundary data and Industrial Production by:\n\nMerging Data: The left_join function merges boundary_data with Industrial Production using the province column as a common key. This results in a new Industrial Productiondataset that includes spatial information (geometry) from boundary_data along with the Industrial Productionindicators for 2012-2022. The left_join ensures that all records from boundary_data are kept, and matching rows from Industrial Productiondata are added.\nRemoving Rows with Missing Data: drop_na removes any rows with NA values from Industrial Productiondata, likely to ensure that only provinces with complete Industrial Production data and spatial information are retained for further analysis. This prevents issues that could arise from missing values during analysis or visualization.\n\nThis approach creates a complete dataset with both spatial and Industrial Productiondata for 2012-2022, facilitating spatial analysis and mapping of competitiveness indicators across Vietnamese provinces.\n\nind_prod &lt;- boundary_data %&gt;%\n  left_join(ind_prod, by = \"province\")\n\nind_prod &lt;- drop_na(ind_prod)\n\n\n\nComputing LISA\nThese codes enhances the Industrial Production 2012-2022 dataset by adding spatial contiguity and weight information as new columns:\n\nCalculate Neighbor List: st_contiguity(geometry) identifies neighboring provinces for each province based on contiguity, and the result is stored in the new column nb. This function creates a list where each province has a record of which other provinces are contiguous to it.\nAssign Weights to Neighbors: st_weights(nb, style=\"W\") calculates a row-standardized weight for each neighbor in nb, stored in the new column wt. The style=\"W\" parameter means that the weights for each province’s neighbors will sum to 1. This type of weight structure is useful for spatial analysis, as it standardizes the influence each neighboring province has on the focal province.\nPlace Columns at the Beginning: The .before = 1 argument ensures that the new columns (nb and wt) are positioned at the beginning of the dataset, making them easy to access and review during analysis.\n\nThis setup embeds spatial structure directly into the Industrial Production dataset, preparing it for further spatial econometric analysis by linking each province with its neighbors and assigning standardized weights.\nThe 2nd code performs Local Moran’s I analysis on the PCI data for 2012-2022 to identify spatial autocorrelation at the provincial level:\n\nCalculate Local Moran’s I: local_moran(industrial_production, nb, wt, nsim=99) computes Local Moran’s I statistic for the Industrial Production variable, which represents the Industrial Production for each province. This function assesses the degree of spatial autocorrelation locally, identifying clusters and outliers of high or low Industrial Production values relative to neighboring provinces:\n\nnb: The neighbors list (spatial contiguity) column created earlier.\nwt: The spatial weights column.\nnsim=99: Sets the number of simulations to 99, used for significance testing to evaluate if the observed spatial patterns are statistically significant.\n\nStore Results in local_moran Column: This result is saved as a new column local_moran. The .before=1 argument ensures that local_moran is placed at the start of the data frame for easy access.\nUnnest the Results: unnest(local_moran) expands the local_moran column if it contains nested data (e.g., lists of statistics for each province), spreading them into separate columns. This makes the Local Moran’s I values for each province more accessible for further analysis or visualization.\n\nThe resulting lisa_ind_2012 dataset provides Local Moran’s I values for each province, allowing me to map spatial clusters and test for the presence of spatially structured patterns in Industrial Production values across Vietnam.

This analysis can reveal regions that have experienced steady industrial growth, those that have faced declines, and areas where industrial activity has fluctuated.\n\nObservations (Trends Over Time):\n\nPersistent Industrial Clusters:\n\nHigh-IPI Clusters: Identify regions that consistently show high IPI values (green shades), suggesting areas with strong and stable industrial growth, possibly due to favorable policies, established infrastructure, or access to skilled labor. These regions might include industrial hubs or economic zones.\nLow-IPI Clusters: Regions with persistent low IPI values (orange and red shades) might be areas struggling with industrialization. This could be due to lack of infrastructure, resources, or investment.\n\nEmergence and Dissipation of Clusters:\n\nEmerging High-IPI Clusters: Look for areas that shift from low to high IPI values over time. This change could indicate recent industrial development, possibly driven by new policies, foreign investments, or infrastructure projects.\nDeclining High-IPI Clusters: If some high-IPI clusters weaken or disappear over time, it could suggest industrial stagnation or relocation of industrial activity to other regions, possibly due to rising costs, regulatory changes, or economic shifts.\n\nGeographic Spread of Industrial Growth:\n\nDetermine if industrial growth is concentrated in specific regions or spreading across the country. A widening of high-IPI clusters over time suggests a decentralization of industrial growth, while concentration in a few areas may indicate limited industrial distribution.\n\nImpact of Regional Policies and Economic Zones:\n\nEconomic Zones and Industrial Parks: Check if specific regions with economic zones or industrial parks show sustained high-IPI clusters. These areas are often intended to boost industrial activity, and sustained high-IPI values would indicate policy success.\nPolicy Interventions: Observe regions that experience noticeable changes in IPI clustering before and after key policies or investments. For instance, if a region shows growth following infrastructure improvements or incentives for industry, this can be seen in the clustering pattern.\n\nRegional Disparities and Development Gaps:\n\nCompare growth patterns between urban and rural areas. Regions with high growth but persistent low-IPI areas nearby might suggest uneven industrial development, highlighting areas that might benefit from targeted support.\n\nEconomic Shocks or Market Trends:\n\nSignificant global or national economic events, such as trade tensions or COVID-19, may disrupt clusters. For example, if some regions experienced lower IPI during 2020-2021, it may reflect pandemic-related industrial slowdowns, while recovery trends can be observed in subsequent years.\n\n\n\n\nConclusion:\n\nIdentify Regions of Consistent Industrial Growth and Stagnation:\n\nRegions with stable high IPI clusters over the years are likely industrial hubs, possibly contributing significantly to Vietnam’s GDP. These regions could serve as benchmarks for developing industrial policy elsewhere in the country.\nPersistent low-IPI clusters highlight areas that may require focused interventions, such as infrastructure upgrades, training programs, or investment incentives to encourage industrial growth.\n\nAssess the Effectiveness of Policies and Economic Zones:\n\nLISA maps over multiple years can reveal how effective economic zones, industrial parks, or regional development policies have been in boosting industrial activity. Regions with emerging high-IPI clusters indicate that such policies may be working well.\nFor regions where industrial growth has declined, policymakers may need to investigate the causes, such as increased production costs, lack of skilled labor, or inadequate infrastructure.\n\n\nThrough this temporal LISA analysis, you can gain a nuanced understanding of how Vietnam’s industrial landscape has evolved, providing valuable insights for strategic planning, regional development, and economic policy formulation.\n\n\n\nComputing local Gi* statistics for Industrial Production\n\n# Create a spatial weights matrix\ncoords_prod &lt;- st_coordinates(st_centroid(ind_prod))\n\nWarning: st_centroid assumes attributes are constant over geometries\n\nnb_prod &lt;- knn2nb(knearneigh(coords_prod, k = 4)) # K-nearest neighbors\nlw_prod &lt;- nb2listw(nb_prod, style = \"W\")\n\n\n# Calculate Getis-Ord Gi* statistic for each region\ngi_star_prod &lt;- localG(ind_prod$Y2022, lw_prod)\n\n# Add Gi* values to the data\nind_prod$gi_star_prod &lt;- as.numeric(gi_star_prod)\n\n\n\nVisualising Hotspot Map\n\n# Create a hotspot map\ntm_shape(ind_prod) +\n  tm_polygons(\"gi_star_prod\", \n              title = \"Getis-Ord Gi* (Indistrial Production Hotspots)\", \n              palette = \"YlOrRd\", \n              style = \"cont\") + \n  tm_layout(main.title = \"Hotspot Analysis: Industrial Production\", \n            legend.outside = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Getis-Ord Gi∗G_i^*Gi∗​ Hotspot Analysis map provides insights into spatial clustering of high and low industrial production index (IPI) values across Vietnam. Here are some observations and conclusions based on this map:\n\nObservations\n\nHigh-Value Hotspots (Red and Orange Regions):\n\nRegions shaded in red and orange, particularly in the southern and northern parts of Vietnam, indicate statistically significant high hotspots for industrial production. These areas have higher IPI values compared to neighboring regions, suggesting they are centers of concentrated industrial activity.\nIn the south, industrial activity is strong near major economic areas, likely including regions around Ho Chi Minh City, where industrial zones and export processing areas are commonly located.\nIn the north, there are also noticeable hotspots, potentially in the vicinity of Hanoi and other industrial centers, reflecting concentrated economic activities.\n\nLow-Value Cold Spots (Dark Red Areas):\n\nThe map indicates cold spots, especially in parts of the northern regions. These areas have lower IPI values, reflecting lower industrial activity relative to their surrounding areas. This may be due to limited infrastructure, resources, or investment in industrial development in these regions.\n\nSpatial Clustering:\n\nThe pattern of clustering shows that industrial production is not uniformly distributed across Vietnam. Instead, it is concentrated in specific geographic clusters, with high-value hotspots in economically active areas and cold spots in less developed regions.\nThe central part of the country has fewer hotspots, suggesting lower industrial activity compared to the northern and southern regions.\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\nIndustrial Concentration in Key Regions:\n\nThe hotspot analysis highlights Vietnam’s reliance on specific regions for industrial output. The northern and southern clusters align with the locations of major cities and industrial zones, suggesting that these regions are driving the country’s industrial economy. These areas are likely benefiting from better infrastructure, investment, and access to markets.\n\nPotential for Targeted Development:\n\nThe low-value cold spots in the north indicate potential areas for targeted industrial development. Policy measures, such as infrastructure development, investment incentives, and workforce training, could help boost industrial production in these regions, addressing regional disparities.\n\n\n\n\n\nUI design\n\n\nWhat Users Can Expect from the LISA Map\n\nCluster Types: Users will see color-coded clusters that indicate areas of similar or contrasting values. For instance:\n\nHH (High-High): Areas with high values surrounded by other high values, indicating potential clusters of high activity.\nLL (Low-Low): Areas with low values surrounded by other low values, suggesting clusters of inactivity or lower intensity.\nHL (High-Low) and LH (Low-High): These patterns indicate spatial outliers, where values contrast with their neighbors.\n\nInteractive Map: Users can zoom in and out to examine specific regions and hover over locations to view additional data or summary statistics for each area.\n\n\n\nHow to Interpret LISA Clusters\n\nSignificant Clusters: High-High and Low-Low clusters often signify spatial patterns that may require further investigation (e.g., clusters of high incidents in certain neighborhoods).\nSpatial Outliers: High-Low and Low-High clusters suggest anomalies, where values in a location differ from the surrounding areas.\n\n\n\nWhat Users Can Expect from the Hotspot Map\n\nColor-Coded Hotspots: Users will see areas marked in gradients of red and blue:\n\nRed (Hotspots): Locations with statistically significant high values, indicating clusters of intense activity.\nBlue (Cold Spots): Areas of statistically significant low values, indicating lower-than-average activity.\n\nConfidence Levels: The intensity of color reflects the statistical significance of the hotspot or cold spot (e.g., 90%, 95%, or 99% confidence).\nInteractivity: Similar to the LISA map, users can interact with this map to explore individual areas in more detail.\n\n\n\nHow to Interpret Hotspot Analysis\n\nHotspots: Red zones highlight areas where values (e.g., crime rates, disease cases) are unusually high. Users might consider these areas as needing targeted attention.\nCold Spots: Blue zones indicate regions with consistently low values, which may serve as control areas or benchmarks.\n\n\n\n\nClicking the navbar menu will drop down the menu to allow users to select between the LISA map for PCI or for index of industrial production"

    "text": "Geographically weighted regression (GWR) is a spatial statistical technique that takes non-stationary variables into consideration (e.g., climate; demographic factors; physical environment characteristics) and models the local relationships between these independent variables and an outcome of interest (also known as dependent variable). In this hands-on exercise, you will learn how to build hedonic pricing models by using GWR methods. The dependent variable is the resale prices of condominium in 2015. The independent variables are divided into either structural and locational.\n\n\n\nTwo data sets will be used in this model building exercise, they are:\n\nURA Master Plan subzone boundary in shapefile format (i.e. MP14_SUBZONE_WEB_PL)\ncondo_resale_2015 in csv format (i.e. condo_resale_2015.csv)\n\n\n\n\nBefore we get started, it is important for us to install the necessary R packages into R and launch these R packages into R environment.\nThe R packages needed for this exercise are as follows:\n\nR package for building OLS and performing diagnostics tests\n\nolsrr\n\nR package for calibrating geographical weighted family of models\n\nGWmodel\n\nR package for multivariate data visualisation and analysis\n\ncorrplot\n\nSpatial data handling\n\nsf\n\nAttribute data handling\n\ntidyverse, especially readr, ggplot2 and dplyr\n\nChoropleth mapping\n\ntmap\n\n\nThe code chunks below installs and launches these R packages into R environment.\n\npacman::p_load(olsrr, corrplot, ggpubr, sf, spdep, GWmodel, tmap, tidyverse, gtsummary)\n\n\n\n\nGWmodel package provides a collection of localised spatial statistical methods, namely: GW summary statistics, GW principal components analysis, GW discriminant analysis and various forms of GW regression; some of which are provided in basic and robust (outlier resistant) forms. Commonly, outputs or parameters of the GWmodel are mapped to provide a useful exploratory tool, which can often precede (and direct) a more traditional or sophisticated statistical analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe geospatial data used in this hands-on exercise is called MP14_SUBZONE_WEB_PL. It is in ESRI shapefile format. The shapefile consists of URA Master Plan 2014’s planning subzone boundaries. Polygon features are used to represent these geographic boundaries. The GIS data is in svy21 projected coordinates systems.\nThe code chunk below is used to import MP_SUBZONE_WEB_PL shapefile by using st_read() of sf packages.\n\nmpsz = st_read(dsn = \"data/geospatial\", layer = \"MP14_SUBZONE_WEB_PL\")\n\nThe report above shows that the R object used to contain the imported MP14_SUBZONE_WEB_PL shapefile is called mpsz and it is a simple feature object. The geometry type is multipolygon. it is also important to note that mpsz simple feature object does not have EPSG information.\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below updates the newly imported mpsz with the correct ESPG code (i.e. 3414)\n\nmpsz_svy21 &lt;- st_transform(mpsz, 3414)\n\nAfter transforming the projection metadata, you can varify the projection of the newly transformed mpsz_svy21 by using st_crs() of sf package.\nThe code chunk below will be used to varify the newly transformed mpsz_svy21.\n\nst_crs(mpsz_svy21)\n\nNotice that the EPSG: is indicated as 3414 now.\nNext, you will reveal the extent of mpsz_svy21 by using st_bbox() of sf package.\n\nst_bbox(mpsz_svy21) #view extent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe condo_resale_2015 is in csv file format. The codes chunk below uses read_csv() function of readr package to import condo_resale_2015 into R as a tibble data frame called condo_resale.\n\ncondo_resale = read_csv(\"data/aspatial/Condo_resale_2015.csv\")\n\nAfter importing the data file into R, it is important for us to examine if the data file has been imported correctly.\nThe codes chunks below uses glimpse() to display the data structure of will do the job.\n\nglimpse(condo_resale)\n\n\nhead(condo_resale$LONGITUDE) #see the data in XCOORD column\n\n\nhead(condo_resale$LATITUDE) #see the data in YCOORD column\n\nNext, summary() of base R is used to display the summary statistics of cond_resale tibble data frame.\n\nsummary(condo_resale)\n\n\n\n\nCurrently, the condo_resale tibble data frame is aspatial. We will convert it to a sf object. The code chunk below converts condo_resale data frame into a simple feature data frame by using st_as_sf() of sf packages.\n\ncondo_resale.sf &lt;- st_as_sf(condo_resale,\n                            coords = c(\"LONGITUDE\", \"LATITUDE\"),\n                            crs=4326) %&gt;%\n  st_transform(crs=3414)\n\nNotice that st_transform() of sf package is used to convert the coordinates from wgs84 (i.e. crs:4326) to svy21 (i.e. crs=3414).\nNext, head() is used to list the content of condo_resale.sf object.\n\nhead(condo_resale.sf)\n\nNotice that the output is in point feature data frame.\n\n\n\n\nIn the section, you will learn how to use statistical graphics functions of ggplot2 package to perform EDA.\n\n\nWe can plot the distribution of SELLING_PRICE by using appropriate Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nggplot(data=condo_resale.sf, aes(x=`SELLING_PRICE`)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\n\nThe figure above reveals a right skewed distribution. This means that more condominium units were transacted at relative lower prices.\nStatistically, the skewed dsitribution can be normalised by using log transformation. The code chunk below is used to derive a new variable called LOG_SELLING_PRICE by using a log transformation on the variable SELLING_PRICE. It is performed using mutate() of dplyr package.\n\ncondo_resale.sf &lt;- condo_resale.sf %&gt;%\n  mutate(`LOG_SELLING_PRICE` = log(SELLING_PRICE))\n\nNow, you can plot the LOG_SELLING_PRICE using the code chunk below.\n\nggplot(data=condo_resale.sf, aes(x=`LOG_SELLING_PRICE`)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\n\nNotice that the distribution is relatively less skewed after the transformation.\n\n\n\nIn this section, you will learn how to draw a small multiple histograms (also known as trellis plot) by using ggarrange() of ggpubr package.\nThe code chunk below is used to create 12 histograms. Then, ggarrange() is used to organised these histogram into a 3 columns by 4 rows small multiple plot.\n\nAREA_SQM &lt;- ggplot(data=condo_resale.sf, aes(x= `AREA_SQM`)) + \n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\n\nAGE &lt;- ggplot(data=condo_resale.sf, aes(x= `AGE`)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\n\nPROX_CBD &lt;- ggplot(data=condo_resale.sf, aes(x= `PROX_CBD`)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\n\nPROX_CHILDCARE &lt;- ggplot(data=condo_resale.sf, aes(x= `PROX_CHILDCARE`)) + \n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\n\nPROX_ELDERLYCARE &lt;- ggplot(data=condo_resale.sf, aes(x= `PROX_ELDERLYCARE`)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\n\nPROX_URA_GROWTH_AREA &lt;- ggplot(data=condo_resale.sf, \n                               aes(x= `PROX_URA_GROWTH_AREA`)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\n\nPROX_HAWKER_MARKET &lt;- ggplot(data=condo_resale.sf, aes(x= `PROX_HAWKER_MARKET`)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\n\nPROX_KINDERGARTEN &lt;- ggplot(data=condo_resale.sf, aes(x= `PROX_KINDERGARTEN`)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\n\nPROX_MRT &lt;- ggplot(data=condo_resale.sf, aes(x= `PROX_MRT`)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\n\nPROX_PARK &lt;- ggplot(data=condo_resale.sf, aes(x= `PROX_PARK`)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\n\nPROX_PRIMARY_SCH &lt;- ggplot(data=condo_resale.sf, aes(x= `PROX_PRIMARY_SCH`)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\n\nPROX_TOP_PRIMARY_SCH &lt;- ggplot(data=condo_resale.sf, \n                               aes(x= `PROX_TOP_PRIMARY_SCH`)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\n\nggarrange(AREA_SQM, AGE, PROX_CBD, PROX_CHILDCARE, PROX_ELDERLYCARE, \n          PROX_URA_GROWTH_AREA, PROX_HAWKER_MARKET, PROX_KINDERGARTEN, PROX_MRT,\n          PROX_PARK, PROX_PRIMARY_SCH, PROX_TOP_PRIMARY_SCH,  \n          ncol = 3, nrow = 4)\n\n\n\n\nLastly, we want to reveal the geospatial distribution condominium resale prices in Singapore. The map will be prepared by using tmap package.\nFirst, we will turn on the interactive mode of tmap by using the code chunk below.\n\ntmap_mode(\"view\")\n\nNext, the code chunks below is used to create an interactive point symbol map.\n\n# Set tmap option to check and fix invalid polygons\ntmap_options(check.and.fix = TRUE)\n\n# Your tmap plotting code\ntm_shape(mpsz_svy21) +\n  tm_polygons() +\ntm_shape(condo_resale.sf) +  \n  tm_dots(col = \"SELLING_PRICE\",\n          alpha = 0.6,\n          style = \"quantile\") +\n  tm_view(set.zoom.limits = c(11, 14))\n\nNotice that tm_dots() is used instead of tm_bubbles().\nset.zoom.limits argument of tm_view() sets the minimum and maximum zoom level to 11 and 14 respectively.\nBefore moving on to the next section, the code below will be used to turn R display into plot mode.\n\ntmap_mode(\"plot\")\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, you will learn how to building hedonic pricing models for condominium resale units using lm() of R base.\n\n\nFirst, we will build a simple linear regression model by using SELLING_PRICE as the dependent variable and AREA_SQM as the independent variable.\n\ncondo.slr &lt;- lm(formula=SELLING_PRICE ~ AREA_SQM, data = condo_resale.sf)\n\nlm() returns an object of class “lm” or for multiple responses of class c(“mlm”, “lm”).\nThe functions summary() and anova() can be used to obtain and print a summary and analysis of variance table of the results. The generic accessor functions coefficients, effects, fitted.values and residuals extract various useful features of the value returned by lm.\n\nsummary(condo.slr)\n\nThe output report reveals that the SELLING_PRICE can be explained by using the formula:\n      *y = -258121.1 + 14719x1*\nThe R-squared of 0.4518 reveals that the simple regression model built is able to explain about 45% of the resale prices.\nSince p-value is much smaller than 0.0001, we will reject the null hypothesis that mean is a good estimator of SELLING_PRICE. This will allow us to infer that simple linear regression model above is a good estimator of SELLING_PRICE.\nThe Coefficients: section of the report reveals that the p-values of both the estimates of the Intercept and ARA_SQM are smaller than 0.001. In view of this, the null hypothesis of the B0 and B1 are equal to 0 will be rejected. As a results, we will be able to infer that the B0 and B1 are good parameter estimates.\nTo visualise the best fit curve on a scatterplot, we can incorporate lm() as a method function in ggplot’s geometry as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nggplot(data=condo_resale.sf,  \n       aes(x=`AREA_SQM`, y=`SELLING_PRICE`)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = lm)\n\nFigure above reveals that there are a few statistical outliers with relatively high selling prices.\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore building a multiple regression model, it is important to ensure that the indepdent variables used are not highly correlated to each other. If these highly correlated independent variables are used in building a regression model by mistake, the quality of the model will be compromised. This phenomenon is known as multicollinearity in statistics.\nCorrelation matrix is commonly used to visualise the relationships between the independent variables. Beside the pairs() of R, there are many packages support the display of a correlation matrix. In this section, the corrplot package will be used.\nThe code chunk below is used to plot a scatterplot matrix of the relationship between the independent variables in condo_resale data.frame.\n\ncorrplot(cor(condo_resale[, 5:23]), diag = FALSE, order = \"AOE\",\n         tl.pos = \"td\", tl.cex = 0.5, method = \"number\", type = \"upper\")\n\nMatrix reorder is very important for mining the hiden structure and patter in the matrix. There are four methods in corrplot (parameter order), named “AOE”, “FPC”, “hclust”, “alphabet”. In the code chunk above, AOE order is used. It orders the variables by using the angular order of the eigenvectors method suggested by Michael Friendly.\nFrom the scatterplot matrix, it is clear that Freehold is highly correlated to LEASE_99YEAR. In view of this, it is wiser to only include either one of them in the subsequent model building. As a result, LEASE_99YEAR is excluded in the subsequent model building.\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below using lm() to calibrate the multiple linear regression model.\n\ncondo.mlr &lt;- lm(formula = SELLING_PRICE ~ AREA_SQM + AGE    + \n                  PROX_CBD + PROX_CHILDCARE + PROX_ELDERLYCARE +\n                  PROX_URA_GROWTH_AREA + PROX_HAWKER_MARKET + PROX_KINDERGARTEN + \n                  PROX_MRT  + PROX_PARK + PROX_PRIMARY_SCH + \n                  PROX_TOP_PRIMARY_SCH + PROX_SHOPPING_MALL + PROX_SUPERMARKET + \n                  PROX_BUS_STOP + NO_Of_UNITS + FAMILY_FRIENDLY + FREEHOLD, \n                data=condo_resale.sf)\nsummary(condo.mlr)\n\n\n\n\nWith reference to the report above, it is clear that not all the independent variables are statistically significant. We will revised the model by removing those variables which are not statistically significant.\nNow, we are ready to calibrate the revised model by using the code chunk below.\n\ncondo.mlr1 &lt;- lm(formula = SELLING_PRICE ~ AREA_SQM + AGE + \n                   PROX_CBD + PROX_CHILDCARE + PROX_ELDERLYCARE +\n                   PROX_URA_GROWTH_AREA + PROX_MRT  + PROX_PARK + \n                   PROX_PRIMARY_SCH + PROX_SHOPPING_MALL    + PROX_BUS_STOP + \n                   NO_Of_UNITS + FAMILY_FRIENDLY + FREEHOLD,\n                 data=condo_resale.sf)\nols_regress(condo.mlr1)\n\n\n\n\nThe gtsummary package provides an elegant and flexible way to create publication-ready summary tables in R.\nIn the code chunk below, tbl_regression() is used to create a well formatted regression report.\n\ntbl_regression(condo.mlr1, intercept = TRUE)1\n\nWith gtsummary package, model statistics can be included in the report by either appending them to the report table by using add_glance_table() or adding as a table source note by using add_glance_source_note() as shown in the code chunk below.\n\ntbl_regression(condo.mlr1, \n               intercept = TRUE) %&gt;% \n  add_glance_source_note(\n    label = list(sigma ~ \"\\U03C3\"),\n    include = c(r.squared, adj.r.squared, \n                AIC, statistic,\n                p.value, sigma))\n\nFor more customisation options, refer to Tutorial: tbl_regression\n\n\nIn this section, we would like to introduce you a fantastic R package specially programmed for performing OLS regression. It is called olsrr. It provides a collection of very useful methods for building better multiple linear regression models:\n\ncomprehensive regression output\nresidual diagnostics\nmeasures of influence\nheteroskedasticity tests\ncollinearity diagnostics\nmodel fit assessment\nvariable contribution assessment\nvariable selection procedures\n\nIn the code chunk below, the ols_vif_tol() of olsrr package is used to test if there are sign of multicollinearity.\n\nols_vif_tol(condo.mlr1)\n\nSince the VIF of the independent variables are less than 10. We can safely conclude that there are no sign of multicollinearity among the independent variables.\n\n\n\nIn multiple linear regression, it is important for us to test the assumption that linearity and additivity of the relationship between dependent and independent variables.\nIn the code chunk below, the ols_plot_resid_fit() of olsrr package is used to perform linearity assumption test.\n\nols_plot_resid_fit(condo.mlr1)\n\nThe figure above reveals that most of the data poitns are scattered around the 0 line, hence we can safely conclude that the relationships between the dependent variable and independent variables are linear.\n\n\n\nLastly, the code chunk below uses ols_plot_resid_hist() of olsrr package to perform normality assumption test.\n\nols_plot_resid_hist(condo.mlr1)\n\nThe figure reveals that the residual of the multiple linear regression model (i.e. condo.mlr1) is resemble normal distribution.\nIf you prefer formal statistical test methods, the ols_test_normality() of olsrr package can be used as shown in the code chun below.\n\nols_test_normality(condo.mlr1)\n\nThe summary table above reveals that the p-values of the four tests are way smaller than the alpha value of 0.05. Hence we will reject the null hypothesis and infer that there is statistical evidence that the residual are not normally distributed.\n\n\n\nThe hedonic model we try to build are using geographically referenced attributes, hence it is also important for us to visual the residual of the hedonic pricing model.\nIn order to perform spatial autocorrelation test, we need to convert condo_resale.sf from sf data frame into a SpatialPointsDataFrame.\nFirst, we will export the residual of the hedonic pricing model and save it as a data frame.\n\nmlr.output &lt;- as.data.frame(condo.mlr1$residuals)\n\nNext, we will join the newly created data frame with condo_resale.sf object.\n\ncondo_resale.res.sf &lt;- cbind(condo_resale.sf, \n                        condo.mlr1$residuals) %&gt;%\nrename(`MLR_RES` = `condo.mlr1.residuals`)\n\nNext, we will convert condo_resale.res.sf from simple feature object into a SpatialPointsDataFrame because spdep package can only process sp conformed spatial data objects.\nThe code chunk below will be used to perform the data conversion process.\n\ncondo_resale.sp &lt;- as_Spatial(condo_resale.res.sf)\ncondo_resale.sp\n\nNext, we will use tmap package to display the distribution of the residuals on an interactive map.\nThe code churn below will turn on the interactive mode of tmap.\n\ntmap_mode(\"view\")\n\nThe code chunks below is used to create an interactive point symbol map.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_svy21)+\n  tmap_options(check.and.fix = TRUE) +\n  tm_polygons(alpha = 0.4) +\ntm_shape(condo_resale.res.sf) +  \n  tm_dots(col = \"MLR_RES\",\n          alpha = 0.6,\n          style=\"quantile\") +\n  tm_view(set.zoom.limits = c(11,14))\n\nRemember to switch back to “plot” mode before continue.\n\ntmap_mode(\"plot\")\n\nThe figure above reveal that there is sign of spatial autocorrelation.\nTo proof that our observation is indeed true, the Moran’s I test will be performed\nFirst, we will compute the distance-based weight matrix by using dnearneigh() function of spdep.\n\nnb &lt;- dnearneigh(coordinates(condo_resale.sp), 0, 1500, longlat = FALSE)\nsummary(nb)\n\nNext, nb2listw() of spdep packge will be used to convert the output neighbours lists (i.e. nb) into a spatial weights.\n\nnb_lw &lt;- nb2listw(nb, style = 'W')\nsummary(nb_lw)\n\nNext, lm.morantest() of spdep package will be used to perform Moran’s I test for residual spatial autocorrelation\n\nlm.morantest(condo.mlr1, nb_lw)\n\nThe Global Moran’s I test for residual spatial autocorrelation shows that it’s p-value is less than 0.00000000000000022 which is less than the alpha value of 0.05. Hence, we will reject the null hypothesis that the residuals are randomly distributed.\nSince the Observed Global Moran I = 0.1424418 which is greater than 0, we can infer than the residuals resemble cluster distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, you are going to learn how to modelling hedonic pricing using both the fixed and adaptive bandwidth schemes\n\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below bw.gwr() of GWModel package is used to determine the optimal fixed bandwidth to use in the model. Notice that the argument adaptive is set to FALSE indicates that we are interested to compute the fixed bandwidth.\nThere are two possible approaches can be uused to determine the stopping rule, they are: CV cross-validation approach and AIC corrected (AICc) approach. We define the stopping rule using approach argeement.\n\nbw.fixed &lt;- bw.gwr(formula = SELLING_PRICE ~ AREA_SQM + AGE + PROX_CBD + \n                     PROX_CHILDCARE + PROX_ELDERLYCARE  + PROX_URA_GROWTH_AREA + \n                     PROX_MRT   + PROX_PARK + PROX_PRIMARY_SCH + \n                     PROX_SHOPPING_MALL + PROX_BUS_STOP + NO_Of_UNITS + \n                     FAMILY_FRIENDLY + FREEHOLD, \n                   data=condo_resale.sp, \n                   approach=\"CV\", \n                   kernel=\"gaussian\", \n                   adaptive=FALSE, \n                   longlat=FALSE)\n\nThe result shows that the recommended bandwidth is 971.3405 metres.\nQuiz: Do you know why it is in metre?\nThe bandwidth in this case is measured in meters because the longlat=FALSE argument was set in the spatial analysis function.\nBy default, many spatial libraries use geographic coordinates (longitude and latitude) when longlat=TRUE, meaning that distances are interpreted in angular units (degrees). However, when longlat=FALSE, the analysis assumes a projected coordinate system where distances are measured in linear units like meters or kilometers, which is common for accurate spatial distance measurements in GIS.\nIn other words, the analysis is performed in a projected coordinate system, such as UTM where the units are in meters. This is essential for accurate distance-based calculations, like kernel density estimation, which would be incorrect if the distances were interpreted in degrees.\nSo, the bandwidth is in meters because the spatial data has been projected into a system that uses meters as the unit of measurement.\n\n\n\nNow we can use the code chunk below to calibrate the gwr model using fixed bandwidth and gaussian kernel.\n\ngwr.fixed &lt;- gwr.basic(formula = SELLING_PRICE ~ AREA_SQM + AGE + PROX_CBD + \n                         PROX_CHILDCARE + PROX_ELDERLYCARE  + PROX_URA_GROWTH_AREA + \n                         PROX_MRT   + PROX_PARK + PROX_PRIMARY_SCH + \n                         PROX_SHOPPING_MALL + PROX_BUS_STOP + NO_Of_UNITS + \n                         FAMILY_FRIENDLY + FREEHOLD, \n                       data=condo_resale.sp, \n                       bw=bw.fixed, \n                       kernel = 'gaussian', \n                       longlat = FALSE)\n\nThe output is saved in a list of class “gwrm”. The code below can be used to display the model output.\n\ngwr.fixed\n\nThe report shows that the AICc of the gwr is 42263.61 which is significantly smaller than the globel multiple linear regression model of 42967.1.\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, we will calibrate the gwr-based hedonic pricing model by using adaptive bandwidth approach.\n\n\nSimilar to the earlier section, we will first use bw.gwr() to determine the recommended data point to use.\nThe code chunk used look very similar to the one used to compute the fixed bandwidth except the adaptive argument has changed to TRUE.\n\nbw.adaptive &lt;- bw.gwr(formula = SELLING_PRICE ~ AREA_SQM + AGE  + \n                        PROX_CBD + PROX_CHILDCARE + PROX_ELDERLYCARE    + \n                        PROX_URA_GROWTH_AREA + PROX_MRT + PROX_PARK + \n                        PROX_PRIMARY_SCH + PROX_SHOPPING_MALL   + PROX_BUS_STOP + \n                        NO_Of_UNITS + FAMILY_FRIENDLY + FREEHOLD, \n                      data=condo_resale.sp, \n                      approach=\"CV\", \n                      kernel=\"gaussian\", \n                      adaptive=TRUE, \n                      longlat=FALSE)\n\nThe result shows that the 30 is the recommended data points to be used.\n\n\n\nNow, we can go ahead to calibrate the gwr-based hedonic pricing model by using adaptive bandwidth and gaussian kernel as shown in the code chunk below.\n\ngwr.adaptive &lt;- gwr.basic(formula = SELLING_PRICE ~ AREA_SQM + AGE + \n                            PROX_CBD + PROX_CHILDCARE + PROX_ELDERLYCARE + \n                            PROX_URA_GROWTH_AREA + PROX_MRT + PROX_PARK + \n                            PROX_PRIMARY_SCH + PROX_SHOPPING_MALL + PROX_BUS_STOP + \n                            NO_Of_UNITS + FAMILY_FRIENDLY + FREEHOLD, \n                          data=condo_resale.sp, bw=bw.adaptive, \n                          kernel = 'gaussian', \n                          adaptive=TRUE, \n                          longlat = FALSE)\n\nThe code below can be used to display the model output.\n\ngwr.adaptive\n\nThe report shows that the AICc the adaptive distance gwr is 41982.22 which is even smaller than the AICc of the fixed distance gwr of 42263.61.\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to regression residuals, the output feature class table includes fields for observed and predicted y values, condition number (cond), Local R2, residuals, and explanatory variable coefficients and standard errors:\n\nCondition Number: this diagnostic evaluates local collinearity. In the presence of strong local collinearity, results become unstable. Results associated with condition numbers larger than 30, may be unreliable.\nLocal R2: these values range between 0.0 and 1.0 and indicate how well the local regression model fits observed y values. Very low values indicate the local model is performing poorly. Mapping the Local R2 values to see where GWR predicts well and where it predicts poorly may provide clues about important variables that may be missing from the regression model.\nPredicted: these are the estimated (or fitted) y values 3. computed by GWR.\nResiduals: to obtain the residual values, the fitted y values are subtracted from the observed y values. Standardized residuals have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of 1. A cold-to-hot rendered map of standardized residuals can be produce by using these values.\nCoefficient Standard Error: these values measure the reliability of each coefficient estimate. Confidence in those estimates are higher when standard errors are small in relation to the actual coefficient values.

    "text": "In this section, you will learn how to building hedonic pricing models for condominium resale units using lm() of R base.\n\n\nFirst, we will build a simple linear regression model by using SELLING_PRICE as the dependent variable and AREA_SQM as the independent variable.\n\ncondo.slr &lt;- lm(formula=SELLING_PRICE ~ AREA_SQM, data = condo_resale.sf)\n\nlm() returns an object of class “lm” or for multiple responses of class c(“mlm”, “lm”).\nThe functions summary() and anova() can be used to obtain and print a summary and analysis of variance table of the results. The generic accessor functions coefficients, effects, fitted.values and residuals extract various useful features of the value returned by lm.\n\nsummary(condo.slr)\n\nThe output report reveals that the SELLING_PRICE can be explained by using the formula:\n      *y = -258121.1 + 14719x1*\nThe R-squared of 0.4518 reveals that the simple regression model built is able to explain about 45% of the resale prices.\nSince p-value is much smaller than 0.0001, we will reject the null hypothesis that mean is a good estimator of SELLING_PRICE. This will allow us to infer that simple linear regression model above is a good estimator of SELLING_PRICE.\nThe Coefficients: section of the report reveals that the p-values of both the estimates of the Intercept and ARA_SQM are smaller than 0.001. In view of this, the null hypothesis of the B0 and B1 are equal to 0 will be rejected. As a results, we will be able to infer that the B0 and B1 are good parameter estimates.\nTo visualise the best fit curve on a scatterplot, we can incorporate lm() as a method function in ggplot’s geometry as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nggplot(data=condo_resale.sf,  \n       aes(x=`AREA_SQM`, y=`SELLING_PRICE`)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = lm)\n\nFigure above reveals that there are a few statistical outliers with relatively high selling prices.\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore building a multiple regression model, it is important to ensure that the indepdent variables used are not highly correlated to each other. If these highly correlated independent variables are used in building a regression model by mistake, the quality of the model will be compromised. This phenomenon is known as multicollinearity in statistics.\nCorrelation matrix is commonly used to visualise the relationships between the independent variables. Beside the pairs() of R, there are many packages support the display of a correlation matrix. In this section, the corrplot package will be used.\nThe code chunk below is used to plot a scatterplot matrix of the relationship between the independent variables in condo_resale data.frame.\n\ncorrplot(cor(condo_resale[, 5:23]), diag = FALSE, order = \"AOE\",\n         tl.pos = \"td\", tl.cex = 0.5, method = \"number\", type = \"upper\")\n\nMatrix reorder is very important for mining the hiden structure and patter in the matrix. There are four methods in corrplot (parameter order), named “AOE”, “FPC”, “hclust”, “alphabet”. In the code chunk above, AOE order is used. It orders the variables by using the angular order of the eigenvectors method suggested by Michael Friendly.\nFrom the scatterplot matrix, it is clear that Freehold is highly correlated to LEASE_99YEAR. In view of this, it is wiser to only include either one of them in the subsequent model building. As a result, LEASE_99YEAR is excluded in the subsequent model building.\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below using lm() to calibrate the multiple linear regression model.\n\ncondo.mlr &lt;- lm(formula = SELLING_PRICE ~ AREA_SQM + AGE    + \n                  PROX_CBD + PROX_CHILDCARE + PROX_ELDERLYCARE +\n                  PROX_URA_GROWTH_AREA + PROX_HAWKER_MARKET + PROX_KINDERGARTEN + \n                  PROX_MRT  + PROX_PARK + PROX_PRIMARY_SCH + \n                  PROX_TOP_PRIMARY_SCH + PROX_SHOPPING_MALL + PROX_SUPERMARKET + \n                  PROX_BUS_STOP + NO_Of_UNITS + FAMILY_FRIENDLY + FREEHOLD, \n                data=condo_resale.sf)\nsummary(condo.mlr)\n\n\n\n\nWith reference to the report above, it is clear that not all the independent variables are statistically significant.

It is called olsrr. It provides a collection of very useful methods for building better multiple linear regression models:\n\ncomprehensive regression output\nresidual diagnostics\nmeasures of influence\nheteroskedasticity tests\ncollinearity diagnostics\nmodel fit assessment\nvariable contribution assessment\nvariable selection procedures\n\nIn the code chunk below, the ols_vif_tol() of olsrr package is used to test if there are sign of multicollinearity.\n\nols_vif_tol(condo.mlr1)\n\nSince the VIF of the independent variables are less than 10. We can safely conclude that there are no sign of multicollinearity among the independent variables.\n\n\n\nIn multiple linear regression, it is important for us to test the assumption that linearity and additivity of the relationship between dependent and independent variables.\nIn the code chunk below, the ols_plot_resid_fit() of olsrr package is used to perform linearity assumption test.\n\nols_plot_resid_fit(condo.mlr1)\n\nThe figure above reveals that most of the data poitns are scattered around the 0 line, hence we can safely conclude that the relationships between the dependent variable and independent variables are linear.\n\n\n\nLastly, the code chunk below uses ols_plot_resid_hist() of olsrr package to perform normality assumption test.\n\nols_plot_resid_hist(condo.mlr1)\n\nThe figure reveals that the residual of the multiple linear regression model (i.e. condo.mlr1) is resemble normal distribution.\nIf you prefer formal statistical test methods, the ols_test_normality() of olsrr package can be used as shown in the code chun below.\n\nols_test_normality(condo.mlr1)\n\nThe summary table above reveals that the p-values of the four tests are way smaller than the alpha value of 0.05. Hence we will reject the null hypothesis and infer that there is statistical evidence that the residual are not normally distributed.\n\n\n\nThe hedonic model we try to build are using geographically referenced attributes, hence it is also important for us to visual the residual of the hedonic pricing model.\nIn order to perform spatial autocorrelation test, we need to convert condo_resale.sf from sf data frame into a SpatialPointsDataFrame.\nFirst, we will export the residual of the hedonic pricing model and save it as a data frame.\n\nmlr.output &lt;- as.data.frame(condo.mlr1$residuals)\n\nNext, we will join the newly created data frame with condo_resale.sf object.\n\ncondo_resale.res.sf &lt;- cbind(condo_resale.sf, \n                        condo.mlr1$residuals) %&gt;%\nrename(`MLR_RES` = `condo.mlr1.residuals`)\n\nNext, we will convert condo_resale.res.sf from simple feature object into a SpatialPointsDataFrame because spdep package can only process sp conformed spatial data objects.\nThe code chunk below will be used to perform the data conversion process.\n\ncondo_resale.sp &lt;- as_Spatial(condo_resale.res.sf)\ncondo_resale.sp\n\nNext, we will use tmap package to display the distribution of the residuals on an interactive map.\nThe code churn below will turn on the interactive mode of tmap.\n\ntmap_mode(\"view\")\n\nThe code chunks below is used to create an interactive point symbol map.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_svy21)+\n  tmap_options(check.and.fix = TRUE) +\n  tm_polygons(alpha = 0.4) +\ntm_shape(condo_resale.res.sf) +  \n  tm_dots(col = \"MLR_RES\",\n          alpha = 0.6,\n          style=\"quantile\") +\n  tm_view(set.zoom.limits = c(11,14))\n\nRemember to switch back to “plot” mode before continue.\n\ntmap_mode(\"plot\")\n\nThe figure above reveal that there is sign of spatial autocorrelation.\nTo proof that our observation is indeed true, the Moran’s I test will be performed\nFirst, we will compute the distance-based weight matrix by using dnearneigh() function of spdep.\n\nnb &lt;- dnearneigh(coordinates(condo_resale.sp), 0, 1500, longlat = FALSE)\nsummary(nb)\n\nNext, nb2listw() of spdep packge will be used to convert the output neighbours lists (i.e. nb) into a spatial weights.\n\nnb_lw &lt;- nb2listw(nb, style = 'W')\nsummary(nb_lw)\n\nNext, lm.morantest() of spdep package will be used to perform Moran’s I test for residual spatial autocorrelation\n\nlm.morantest(condo.mlr1, nb_lw)\n\nThe Global Moran’s I test for residual spatial autocorrelation shows that it’s p-value is less than 0.00000000000000022 which is less than the alpha value of 0.05. Hence, we will reject the null hypothesis that the residuals are randomly distributed.\nSince the Observed Global Moran I = 0.1424418 which is greater than 0, we can infer than the residuals resemble cluster distribution."

    "text": "In this section, you are going to learn how to modelling hedonic pricing using both the fixed and adaptive bandwidth schemes\n\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below bw.gwr() of GWModel package is used to determine the optimal fixed bandwidth to use in the model. Notice that the argument adaptive is set to FALSE indicates that we are interested to compute the fixed bandwidth.\nThere are two possible approaches can be uused to determine the stopping rule, they are: CV cross-validation approach and AIC corrected (AICc) approach. We define the stopping rule using approach argeement.\n\nbw.fixed &lt;- bw.gwr(formula = SELLING_PRICE ~ AREA_SQM + AGE + PROX_CBD + \n                     PROX_CHILDCARE + PROX_ELDERLYCARE  + PROX_URA_GROWTH_AREA + \n                     PROX_MRT   + PROX_PARK + PROX_PRIMARY_SCH + \n                     PROX_SHOPPING_MALL + PROX_BUS_STOP + NO_Of_UNITS + \n                     FAMILY_FRIENDLY + FREEHOLD, \n                   data=condo_resale.sp, \n                   approach=\"CV\", \n                   kernel=\"gaussian\", \n                   adaptive=FALSE, \n                   longlat=FALSE)\n\nThe result shows that the recommended bandwidth is 971.3405 metres.\nQuiz: Do you know why it is in metre?\nThe bandwidth in this case is measured in meters because the longlat=FALSE argument was set in the spatial analysis function.\nBy default, many spatial libraries use geographic coordinates (longitude and latitude) when longlat=TRUE, meaning that distances are interpreted in angular units (degrees). However, when longlat=FALSE, the analysis assumes a projected coordinate system where distances are measured in linear units like meters or kilometers, which is common for accurate spatial distance measurements in GIS.\nIn other words, the analysis is performed in a projected coordinate system, such as UTM where the units are in meters. This is essential for accurate distance-based calculations, like kernel density estimation, which would be incorrect if the distances were interpreted in degrees.\nSo, the bandwidth is in meters because the spatial data has been projected into a system that uses meters as the unit of measurement.\n\n\n\nNow we can use the code chunk below to calibrate the gwr model using fixed bandwidth and gaussian kernel.\n\ngwr.fixed &lt;- gwr.basic(formula = SELLING_PRICE ~ AREA_SQM + AGE + PROX_CBD + \n                         PROX_CHILDCARE + PROX_ELDERLYCARE  + PROX_URA_GROWTH_AREA + \n                         PROX_MRT   + PROX_PARK + PROX_PRIMARY_SCH + \n                         PROX_SHOPPING_MALL + PROX_BUS_STOP + NO_Of_UNITS + \n                         FAMILY_FRIENDLY + FREEHOLD, \n                       data=condo_resale.sp, \n                       bw=bw.fixed, \n                       kernel = 'gaussian', \n                       longlat = FALSE)\n\nThe output is saved in a list of class “gwrm”. The code below can be used to display the model output.\n\ngwr.fixed\n\nThe report shows that the AICc of the gwr is 42263.61 which is significantly smaller than the globel multiple linear regression model of 42967.1.\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, we will calibrate the gwr-based hedonic pricing model by using adaptive bandwidth approach.\n\n\nSimilar to the earlier section, we will first use bw.gwr() to determine the recommended data point to use.\nThe code chunk used look very similar to the one used to compute the fixed bandwidth except the adaptive argument has changed to TRUE.\n\nbw.adaptive &lt;- bw.gwr(formula = SELLING_PRICE ~ AREA_SQM + AGE  + \n                        PROX_CBD + PROX_CHILDCARE + PROX_ELDERLYCARE    + \n                        PROX_URA_GROWTH_AREA + PROX_MRT + PROX_PARK + \n                        PROX_PRIMARY_SCH + PROX_SHOPPING_MALL   + PROX_BUS_STOP + \n                        NO_Of_UNITS + FAMILY_FRIENDLY + FREEHOLD, \n                      data=condo_resale.sp, \n                      approach=\"CV\", \n                      kernel=\"gaussian\", \n                      adaptive=TRUE, \n                      longlat=FALSE)\n\nThe result shows that the 30 is the recommended data points to be used.\n\n\n\nNow, we can go ahead to calibrate the gwr-based hedonic pricing model by using adaptive bandwidth and gaussian kernel as shown in the code chunk below.\n\ngwr.adaptive &lt;- gwr.basic(formula = SELLING_PRICE ~ AREA_SQM + AGE + \n                            PROX_CBD + PROX_CHILDCARE + PROX_ELDERLYCARE + \n                            PROX_URA_GROWTH_AREA + PROX_MRT + PROX_PARK + \n                            PROX_PRIMARY_SCH + PROX_SHOPPING_MALL + PROX_BUS_STOP + \n                            NO_Of_UNITS + FAMILY_FRIENDLY + FREEHOLD, \n                          data=condo_resale.sp, bw=bw.adaptive, \n                          kernel = 'gaussian', \n                          adaptive=TRUE, \n                          longlat = FALSE)\n\nThe code below can be used to display the model output.\n\ngwr.adaptive\n\nThe report shows that the AICc the adaptive distance gwr is 41982.22 which is even smaller than the AICc of the fixed distance gwr of 42263.61.\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to regression residuals, the output feature class table includes fields for observed and predicted y values, condition number (cond), Local R2, residuals, and explanatory variable coefficients and standard errors:\n\nCondition Number: this diagnostic evaluates local collinearity. In the presence of strong local collinearity, results become unstable. Results associated with condition numbers larger than 30, may be unreliable.\nLocal R2: these values range between 0.0 and 1.0 and indicate how well the local regression model fits observed y values. Very low values indicate the local model is performing poorly. Mapping the Local R2 values to see where GWR predicts well and where it predicts poorly may provide clues about important variables that may be missing from the regression model.\nPredicted: these are the estimated (or fitted) y values 3. computed by GWR.\nResiduals: to obtain the residual values, the fitted y values are subtracted from the observed y values. Standardized residuals have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of 1. A cold-to-hot rendered map of standardized residuals can be produce by using these values.\nCoefficient Standard Error: these values measure the reliability of each coefficient estimate. Confidence in those estimates are higher when standard errors are small in relation to the actual coefficient values. Large standard errors may indicate problems with local collinearity.\n\nThey are all stored in a SpatialPointsDataFrame or SpatialPolygonsDataFrame object integrated with fit.points, GWR coefficient estimates, y value, predicted values, coefficient standard errors and t-values in its “data” slot in an object called SDF of the output list.\n\n\n\nTo visualise the fields in SDF, we need to first covert it into sf data.frame by using the code chunk below.\n\ncondo_resale.sf.adaptive &lt;- st_as_sf(gwr.adaptive$SDF) %&gt;%\n  st_transform(crs=3414)\n\n\ncondo_resale.sf.adaptive.svy21 &lt;- st_transform(condo_resale.sf.adaptive, 3414)\ncondo_resale.sf.adaptive.svy21  \n\n\ngwr.adaptive.output &lt;- as.data.frame(gwr.adaptive$SDF)\ncondo_resale.sf.adaptive &lt;- cbind(condo_resale.res.sf, as.matrix(gwr.adaptive.output))\n\nNext, glimpse() is used to display the content of condo_resale.sf.adaptive sf data frame.\n\nglimpse(condo_resale.sf.adaptive)\n\n\nsummary(gwr.adaptive$SDF$yhat)\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunks below is used to create an interactive point symbol map.\n\ntmap_mode(\"view\")\ntm_shape(mpsz_svy21)+\n  tm_polygons(alpha = 0.1) +\ntm_shape(condo_resale.sf.adaptive) +  \n  tm_dots(col = \"Local_R2\",\n          border.col = \"gray60\",\n          border.lwd = 1) +\n  tm_view(set.zoom.limits = c(11,14))\n\nSet back to plotting mode\n\ntmap_mode(\"plot\")\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunks below is used to create an interactive point symbol map.\n\ntmap_mode(\"view\")\nAREA_SQM_SE &lt;- tm_shape(mpsz_svy21)+\n  tm_polygons(alpha = 0.1) +\ntm_shape(condo_resale.sf.adaptive) +  \n  tm_dots(col = \"AREA_SQM_SE\",\n          border.col = \"gray60\",\n          border.lwd = 1) +\n  tm_view(set.zoom.limits = c(11,14))\n\nAREA_SQM_TV &lt;- tm_shape(mpsz_svy21)+\n  tm_polygons(alpha = 0.1) +\ntm_shape(condo_resale.sf.adaptive) +  \n  tm_dots(col = \"AREA_SQM_TV\",\n          border.col = \"gray60\",\n          border.lwd = 1) +\n  tm_view(set.zoom.limits = c(11,14))\n\ntmap_arrange(AREA_SQM_SE, AREA_SQM_TV, \n             asp=1, ncol=2,\n             sync = TRUE)\n\nSet back to plotting mode\n\ntmap_mode(\"plot\")\n\n\n\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_svy21[mpsz_svy21$REGION_N==\"CENTRAL REGION\", ])+\n  tm_polygons()+\ntm_shape(condo_resale.sf.adaptive) + \n  tm_bubbles(col = \"Local_R2\",\n           size = 0.15,\n           border.col = \"gray60\",\n           border.lwd = 1)"

This will be performed by using the left_join function of dplyr package. The shan_sf simple feature data.frame will be used as the base data object and the ict_derived data.frame will be used as the join table.\nThe code chunks below is used to perform the task. The unique identifier used to join both data objects is TS_PCODE.\n\nshan_sf &lt;- left_join(shan_sf, \n                     ict_derived, by=c(\"TS_PCODE\"=\"TS_PCODE\"))\n  \nwrite_rds(shan_sf, \"data/rds/shan_sf.rds\")\n\nThe message above shows that TS_CODE field is the common field used to perform the left-join.\nIt is important to note that there is no new output data been created. Instead, the data fields from ict_derived data frame are now updated into the data frame of shan_sf.\n\nshan_sf &lt;- read_rds(\"data/rds/shan_sf.rds\")\n\n\n\n\nTo have a quick look at the distribution of Radio penetration rate of Shan State at township level, a choropleth map will be prepared.\nThe code chunks below are used to prepare the choroplethby using the qtm() function of tmap package.\n\nqtm(shan_sf, \"RADIO_PR\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to reveal the distribution shown in the choropleth map above are bias to the underlying total number of households at the townships, we will create two choropleth maps, one for the total number of households (i.e. TT_HOUSEHOLDS.map) and one for the total number of household with Radio (RADIO.map) by using the code chunk below.\n\nTT_HOUSEHOLDS.map &lt;- tm_shape(shan_sf) + \n  tm_fill(col = \"TT_HOUSEHOLDS\",\n          n = 5,\n          style = \"jenks\", \n          title = \"Total households\") + \n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) \n\nRADIO.map &lt;- tm_shape(shan_sf) + \n  tm_fill(col = \"RADIO\",\n          n = 5,\n          style = \"jenks\",\n          title = \"Number Radio \") + \n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) \n\ntmap_arrange(TT_HOUSEHOLDS.map, RADIO.map,\n             asp=NA, ncol=2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the choropleth maps above clearly show that townships with relatively larger number ot households are also showing relatively higher number of radio ownership.\nNow let us plot the choropleth maps showing the dsitribution of total number of households and Radio penetration rate by using the code chunk below.\n\ntm_shape(shan_sf) +\n    tm_polygons(c(\"TT_HOUSEHOLDS\", \"RADIO_PR\"),\n                style=\"jenks\") +\n    tm_facets(sync = TRUE, ncol = 2) +\n  tm_legend(legend.position = c(\"right\", \"bottom\"))+\n  tm_layout(outer.margins=0, asp=0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan you identify the differences?\nANS: The patterns of distribution are different. The map showing the distribution of total number of households shows a relatively uniform distribution, with higher concentrations in the central and southern parts of the state. The map showing the distribution of radio penetration rate shows a more concentrated pattern, with higher rates in the central and northern parts of the state. Overall, the maps show that townships with relatively larger numbers of households do not necessarily have higher radio penetration rates"

The standardization methods, particularly z-score standardization, help to normalize the distribution, making it easier to compare and analyze the data.\n\nr &lt;- ggplot(data=ict_derived, \n             aes(x= `RADIO_PR`)) +\n  geom_density(color=\"black\",\n               fill=\"light blue\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Raw values without standardisation\")\n\nshan_ict_s_df &lt;- as.data.frame(shan_ict.std)\ns &lt;- ggplot(data=shan_ict_s_df, \n       aes(x=`RADIO_PR`)) +\n  geom_density(color=\"black\",\n               fill=\"light blue\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Min-Max Standardisation\")\n\nshan_ict_z_df &lt;- as.data.frame(shan_ict.z)\nz &lt;- ggplot(data=shan_ict_z_df, \n       aes(x=`RADIO_PR`)) +\n  geom_density(color=\"black\",\n               fill=\"light blue\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Z-score Standardisation\")\n\nggarrange(r, s, z,\n          ncol = 3,\n          nrow = 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn R, many packages provide functions to calculate distance matrix. We will compute the proximity matrix by using dist() of R.\ndist() supports six distance proximity calculations, they are: euclidean, maximum, manhattan, canberra, binary and minkowski. The default is euclidean proximity matrix.\nThe code chunk below is used to compute the proximity matrix using euclidean method.\n\nproxmat &lt;- dist(shan_ict, method = 'euclidean')\n\nThe code chunk

hierarchical clustering function. In this hands-on exercise, hclust() of R stats will be used.\nhclust() employed agglomeration method to compute the cluster. Eight clustering algorithms are supported, they are: ward.D, ward.D2, single, complete, average(UPGMA), mcquitty(WPGMA), median(WPGMC) and centroid(UPGMC).\nThe code chunk below performs hierarchical cluster analysis using ward.D method. The hierarchical clustering output is stored in an object of class hclust which describes the tree produced by the clustering process.\n\nhclust_ward &lt;- hclust(proxmat, method = 'ward.D')\n\n\n\n\nIn R, there are several packages provide hierarchical clustering function.

The hierarchical clustering output is stored in an object of class hclust which describes the tree produced by the clustering process.\n\nhclust_ward &lt;- hclust(proxmat, method = 'ward.D')\n\nWe can then plot the tree by using plot() of R Graphics as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nplot(hclust_ward, cex = 0.6)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the challenge in performing hierarchical clustering is to identify stronger clustering structures. The issue can be solved by using use agnes() function of cluster package. It functions like hclus(), however, with the agnes() function you can also get the agglomerative coefficient, which measures the amount of clustering structure found (values closer to 1 suggest strong clustering structure).\nThe code chunk below will be used to compute the agglomerative coefficients of all hierarchical clustering algorithms.\n\nm &lt;- c( \"average\", \"single\", \"complete\", \"ward\")\nnames(m) &lt;- c( \"average\", \"single\", \"complete\", \"ward\")\n\nac &lt;- function(x) {\n  agnes(shan_ict, method = x)$ac\n}\n\nmap_dbl(m, ac)\n\n  average    single  complete      ward \n0.8131144 0.6628705 0.8950702 0.9427730 \n\n\nWith reference to the output above, we can see that Ward’s method provides the strongest clustering structure among the four methods assessed. Hence, in the subsequent analysis, only Ward’s method will be used.\n\n\n\nAnother technical challenge face by data analyst in performing clustering analysis is to determine the optimal clusters to retain.\nThere are three commonly used methods to determine the optimal clusters, they are:\n\nElbow Method\nAverage Silhouette Method\nGap Statistic Method\n\n\n\nThe gap statistic compares the total within intra-cluster variation for different values of k with their expected values under null reference distribution of the data. The estimate of the optimal clusters will be value that maximize the gap statistic (i.e., that yields the largest gap statistic). This means that the clustering structure is far away from the random uniform distribution of points.\nTo compute the gap statistic, clusGap() of cluster package will be used.\n\nset.seed(12345)\ngap_stat &lt;- clusGap(shan_ict, \n                    FUN = hcut, \n                    nstart = 25, \n                    K.max = 10, \n                    B = 50)\n# Print the result\nprint(gap_stat, method = \"firstmax\")\n\nClustering Gap statistic [\"clusGap\"] from call:\nclusGap(x = shan_ict, FUNcluster = hcut, K.max = 10, B = 50, nstart = 25)\nB=50 simulated reference sets, k = 1..10; spaceH0=\"scaledPCA\"\n --&gt; Number of clusters (method 'firstmax'): 1\n          logW   E.logW       gap     SE.sim\n [1,] 8.407129 8.680794 0.2736651 0.04460994\n [2,] 8.130029 8.350712 0.2206824 0.03880130\n [3,] 7.992265 8.202550 0.2102844 0.03362652\n [4,] 7.862224 8.080655 0.2184311 0.03784781\n [5,] 7.756461 7.978022 0.2215615 0.03897071\n [6,] 7.665594 7.887777 0.2221833 0.03973087\n [7,] 7.590919 7.806333 0.2154145 0.04054939\n [8,] 7.526680 7.731619 0.2049390 0.04198644\n [9,] 7.458024 7.660795 0.2027705 0.04421874\n[10,] 7.377412 7.593858 0.2164465 0.04540947\n\n\nAlso note that the hcut function used is from factoextra package.\nNext, we can visualise the plot by using fviz_gap_stat() of factoextra package.\n\nfviz_gap_stat(gap_stat)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith reference to the gap statistic graph above, the recommended number of cluster to retain is 1. However, it is not logical to retain only one cluster. By examine the gap statistic graph, the 6-cluster gives the largest gap statistic and should be the next best cluster to pick.\nNote: In addition to these commonly used approaches, the NbClust package, published by Charrad et al., 2014, provides 30 indices for determining the relevant number of clusters and proposes to users the best clustering scheme from the different results obtained by varying all combinations of number of clusters, distance measures, and clustering methods.\n\n\n\n\nIn the dendrogram displayed above, each leaf corresponds to one observation. As we move up the tree, observations that are similar to each other are combined into branches, which are themselves fused at a higher height.\nThe height of the fusion, provided on the vertical axis, indicates the (dis)similarity between two observations. The higher the height of the fusion, the less similar the observations are. Note that, conclusions about the proximity of two observations can be drawn only based on the height where branches containing those two observations first are fused. We cannot use the proximity of two observations along the horizontal axis as a criteria of their similarity.\nIt’s also possible to draw the dendrogram with a border around the selected clusters by using rect.hclust() of R stats. The argument border is used to specify the border colors for the rectangles.\n\nplot(hclust_ward, cex = 0.6)\nrect.hclust(hclust_ward, \n            k = 6, \n            border = 2:5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, we will learn how to perform visually-driven hiearchical clustering analysis by using heatmaply package.\nWith heatmaply, we are able to build both highly interactive cluster heatmap or static cluster heatmap.\n\n\nThe data was loaded into a data frame, but it has to be a data matrix to make your heatmap.\nThe code chunk below will be used to transform shan_ict data frame into a data matrix.\n\nshan_ict_mat &lt;- data.matrix(shan_ict)\n\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, the heatmaply() of heatmaply package is used to build an interactive cluster heatmap.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(shan_ict_mat),\n          Colv=NA,\n          dist_method = \"euclidean\",\n          hclust_method = \"ward.D\",\n          seriate = \"OLO\",\n          colors = Blues,\n          k_row = 6,\n          margins = c(NA,200,60,NA),\n          fontsize_row = 4,\n          fontsize_col = 5,\n          main=\"Geographic Segmentation of Shan State by ICT indicators\",\n          xlab = \"ICT Indicators\",\n          ylab = \"Townships of Shan State\"\n          )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith closed examination of the dendragram above, we have decided to retain six clusters.\ncutree() of R Base will be used in the code chunk below to derive a 6-cluster model.\n\ngroups &lt;- as.factor(cutree(hclust_ward, k=6))\n\nThe output is called groups. It is a list object.\nIn order to visualise the clusters, the groups object need to be appended onto shan_sf simple feature object.\nThe code chunk below form the join in three steps:\n\nthe groups list object will be converted into a matrix;\ncbind() is used to append groups matrix onto shan_sf to produce an output simple feature object called shan_sf_cluster; and\nrename of dplyr package is used to rename as.matrix.groups field as CLUSTER.\n\n\nshan_sf_cluster &lt;- cbind(shan_sf, as.matrix(groups)) %&gt;%\n  rename(`CLUSTER`=`as.matrix.groups.`)\n\nNext, qtm() of tmap package is used to plot the choropleth map showing the cluster formed.\n\nqtm(shan_sf_cluster, \"CLUSTER\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe choropleth map above reveals the clusters are very fragmented. The is one of the major limitation when non-spatial clustering algorithm such as hierarchical cluster analysis method is used."

    "text": "Predictive modelling uses statistical learning or machine learning techniques to predict outcomes. By and large, the event one wants to predict is in the future. However, a set of known outcome and predictors (also known as variables) will be used to calibrate the predictive models.\nGeospatial predictive modelling is conceptually rooted in the principle that the occurrences of events being modeled are limited in distribution. When geographically referenced data are used, occurrences of events are neither uniform nor random in distribution over space. There are geospatial factors (infrastructure, sociocultural, topographic, etc.) that constrain and influence where the locations of events occur. Geospatial predictive modeling attempts to describe those constraints and influences by spatially correlating occurrences of historical geospatial locations with environmental factors that represent those constraints and influences.\n\n\nIn this in-class exercise, you will learn how to build predictive model by using geographical random forest method. By the end of this hands-on exercise, you will acquire the skills of:\n\npreparing training and test data sets by using appropriate data sampling methods,\ncalibrating predictive models by using both geospatial statistical learning and machine learning methods,\ncomparing and selecting the best model for predicting the future outcome,\npredicting the future outcomes by using the best model calibrated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAspatial dataset:\n\nHDB Resale data: a list of HDB resale transacted prices in Singapore from Jan 2017 onwards.

    "text": "Predictive modelling uses statistical learning or machine learning techniques to predict outcomes. By and large, the event one wants to predict is in the future. However, a set of known outcome and predictors (also known as variables) will be used to calibrate the predictive models.\nGeospatial predictive modelling is conceptually rooted in the principle that the occurrences of events being modeled are limited in distribution. When geographically referenced data are used, occurrences of events are neither uniform nor random in distribution over space. There are geospatial factors (infrastructure, sociocultural, topographic, etc.) that constrain and influence where the locations of events occur. Geospatial predictive modeling attempts to describe those constraints and influences by spatially correlating occurrences of historical geospatial locations with environmental factors that represent those constraints and influences.\n\n\nIn this in-class exercise, you will learn how to build predictive model by using geographical random forest method. By the end of this hands-on exercise, you will acquire the skills of:\n\npreparing training and test data sets by using appropriate data sampling methods,\ncalibrating predictive models by using both geospatial statistical learning and machine learning methods,\ncomparing and selecting the best model for predicting the future outcome,\npredicting the future outcomes by using the best model calibrated."

    "text": "In this section, you are going to learn how to modelling hedonic pricing using both the fixed and adaptive bandwidth schemes\n\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below bw.gwr() of GWModel package is used to determine the optimal fixed bandwidth to use in the model. Notice that the argument adaptive is set to FALSE indicates that we are interested to compute the fixed bandwidth.\nThere are two possible approaches can be uused to determine the stopping rule, they are: CV cross-validation approach and AIC corrected (AICc) approach. We define the stopping rule using approach argeement.\n\nbw.fixed &lt;- bw.gwr(formula = SELLING_PRICE ~ AREA_SQM + AGE + PROX_CBD + \n                     PROX_CHILDCARE + PROX_ELDERLYCARE  + PROX_URA_GROWTH_AREA + \n                     PROX_MRT   + PROX_PARK + PROX_PRIMARY_SCH + \n                     PROX_SHOPPING_MALL + PROX_BUS_STOP + NO_Of_UNITS + \n                     FAMILY_FRIENDLY + FREEHOLD, \n                   data=condo_resale.sp, \n                   approach=\"CV\", \n                   kernel=\"gaussian\", \n                   adaptive=FALSE, \n                   longlat=FALSE)\n\nThe result shows that the recommended bandwidth is 971.3405 metres.\nQuiz: Do you know why it is in metre?\nThe bandwidth in this case is measured in meters because the longlat=FALSE argument was set in the spatial analysis function.\nBy default, many spatial libraries use geographic coordinates (longitude and latitude) when longlat=TRUE, meaning that distances are interpreted in angular units (degrees). However, when longlat=FALSE, the analysis assumes a projected coordinate system where distances are measured in linear units like meters or kilometers, which is common for accurate spatial distance measurements in GIS.\nIn other words, the analysis is performed in a projected coordinate system, such as UTM where the units are in meters. This is essential for accurate distance-based calculations, like kernel density estimation, which would be incorrect if the distances were interpreted in degrees.\nSo, the bandwidth is in meters because the spatial data has been projected into a system that uses meters as the unit of measurement.\n\n\n\nNow we can use the code chunk below to calibrate the gwr model using fixed bandwidth and gaussian kernel.\n\ngwr.fixed &lt;- gwr.basic(formula = SELLING_PRICE ~ AREA_SQM + AGE + PROX_CBD + \n                         PROX_CHILDCARE + PROX_ELDERLYCARE  + PROX_URA_GROWTH_AREA + \n                         PROX_MRT   + PROX_PARK + PROX_PRIMARY_SCH + \n                         PROX_SHOPPING_MALL + PROX_BUS_STOP + NO_Of_UNITS + \n                         FAMILY_FRIENDLY + FREEHOLD, \n                       data=condo_resale.sp, \n                       bw=bw.fixed, \n                       kernel = 'gaussian', \n                       longlat = FALSE)\n\nThe output is saved in a list of class “gwrm”. The code below can be used to display the model output.\n\ngwr.fixed\n\nThe report shows that the AICc of the gwr is 42263.61 which is significantly smaller than the globel multiple linear regression model of 42967.1.\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, we will calibrate the gwr-based hedonic pricing model by using adaptive bandwidth approach.\n\n\nSimilar to the earlier section, we will first use bw.gwr() to determine the recommended data point to use.\nThe code chunk used look very similar to the one used to compute the fixed bandwidth except the adaptive argument has changed to TRUE.\n\nbw.adaptive &lt;- bw.gwr(formula = SELLING_PRICE ~ AREA_SQM + AGE  + \n                        PROX_CBD + PROX_CHILDCARE + PROX_ELDERLYCARE    + \n                        PROX_URA_GROWTH_AREA + PROX_MRT + PROX_PARK + \n                        PROX_PRIMARY_SCH + PROX_SHOPPING_MALL   + PROX_BUS_STOP + \n                        NO_Of_UNITS + FAMILY_FRIENDLY + FREEHOLD, \n                      data=condo_resale.sp, \n                      approach=\"CV\", \n                      kernel=\"gaussian\", \n                      adaptive=TRUE, \n                      longlat=FALSE)\n\nThe result shows that the 30 is the recommended data points to be used.\n\n\n\nNow, we can go ahead to calibrate the gwr-based hedonic pricing model by using adaptive bandwidth and gaussian kernel as shown in the code chunk below.\n\ngwr.adaptive &lt;- gwr.basic(formula = SELLING_PRICE ~ AREA_SQM + AGE + \n                            PROX_CBD + PROX_CHILDCARE + PROX_ELDERLYCARE + \n                            PROX_URA_GROWTH_AREA + PROX_MRT + PROX_PARK + \n                            PROX_PRIMARY_SCH + PROX_SHOPPING_MALL + PROX_BUS_STOP + \n                            NO_Of_UNITS + FAMILY_FRIENDLY + FREEHOLD, \n                          data=condo_resale.sp, bw=bw.adaptive, \n                          kernel = 'gaussian', \n                          adaptive=TRUE, \n                          longlat = FALSE)\n\nThe code below can be used to display the model output.\n\ngwr.adaptive\n\nThe report shows that the AICc the adaptive distance gwr is 41982.22 which is even smaller than the AICc of the fixed distance gwr of 42263.61.\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to regression residuals, the output feature class table includes fields for observed and predicted y values, condition number (cond), Local R2, residuals, and explanatory variable coefficients and standard errors:\n\nCondition Number: this diagnostic evaluates local collinearity. In the presence of strong local collinearity, results become unstable. Results associated with condition numbers larger than 30, may be unreliable.\nLocal R2: these values range between 0.0 and 1.0 and indicate how well the local regression model fits observed y values. Very low values indicate the local model is performing poorly. Mapping the Local R2 values to see where GWR predicts well and where it predicts poorly may provide clues about important variables that may be missing from the regression model.\nPredicted: these are the estimated (or fitted) y values 3. computed by GWR.\nResiduals: to obtain the residual values, the fitted y values are subtracted from the observed y values. Standardized residuals have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of 1. A cold-to-hot rendered map of standardized residuals can be produce by using these values.\nCoefficient Standard Error: these values measure the reliability of each coefficient estimate. Confidence in those estimates are higher when standard errors are small in relation to the actual coefficient values. Large standard errors may indicate problems with local collinearity.\n\nThey are all stored in a SpatialPointsDataFrame or SpatialPolygonsDataFrame object integrated with fit.points, GWR coefficient estimates, y value, predicted values, coefficient standard errors and t-values in its “data” slot in an object called SDF of the output list.\n\n\n\nTo visualise the fields in SDF, we need to first covert it into sf data.frame by using the code chunk below.\n\ncondo_resale.sf.adaptive &lt;- st_as_sf(gwr.adaptive$SDF) %&gt;%\n  st_transform(crs=3414)\n\n\ncondo_resale.sf.adaptive.svy21 &lt;- st_transform(condo_resale.sf.adaptive, 3414)\ncondo_resale.sf.adaptive.svy21  \n\n\ngwr.adaptive.output &lt;- as.data.frame(gwr.adaptive$SDF)\ncondo_resale.sf.adaptive &lt;- cbind(condo_resale.res.sf, as.matrix(gwr.adaptive.output))\n\nNext, glimpse() is used to display the content of condo_resale.sf.adaptive sf data frame.\n\nglimpse(condo_resale.sf.adaptive)\n\n\nsummary(gwr.adaptive$SDF$yhat)\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunks below is used to create an interactive point symbol map.\n\ntmap_mode(\"view\")\ntm_shape(mpsz_svy21)+\n  tm_polygons(alpha = 0.1) +\ntm_shape(condo_resale.sf.adaptive) +  \n  tm_dots(col = \"Local_R2\",\n          border.col = \"gray60\",\n          border.lwd = 1) +\n  tm_view(set.zoom.limits = c(11,14))\n\nSet back to plotting mode\n\ntmap_mode(\"plot\")\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunks below is used to create an interactive point symbol map.\n\ntmap_mode(\"view\")\nAREA_SQM_SE &lt;- tm_shape(mpsz_svy21)+\n  tm_polygons(alpha = 0.1) +\ntm_shape(condo_resale.sf.adaptive) +  \n  tm_dots(col = \"AREA_SQM_SE\",\n          border.col = \"gray60\",\n          border.lwd = 1) +\n  tm_view(set.zoom.limits = c(11,14))\n\nAREA_SQM_TV &lt;- tm_shape(mpsz_svy21)+\n  tm_polygons(alpha = 0.1) +\ntm_shape(condo_resale.sf.adaptive) +  \n  tm_dots(col = \"AREA_SQM_TV\",\n          border.col = \"gray60\",\n          border.lwd = 1) +\n  tm_view(set.zoom.limits = c(11,14))\n\ntmap_arrange(AREA_SQM_SE, AREA_SQM_TV, \n             asp=1, ncol=2,\n             sync = TRUE)\n\nSet back to plotting mode\n\ntmap_mode(\"plot\")\n\n\n\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_svy21[mpsz_svy21$REGION_N==\"CENTRAL REGION\", ])+\n  tm_polygons()+\ntm_shape(condo_resale.sf.adaptive) + \n  tm_bubbles(col = \"Local_R2\",\n           size = 0.15,\n           border.col = \"gray60\",\n           border.lwd = 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGollini I, Lu B, Charlton M, Brunsdon C, Harris P (2015) “GWmodel: an R Package for exploring Spatial Heterogeneity using Geographically Weighted Models”.

    "text": "In this section, you will learn how to building hedonic pricing models for condominium resale units using lm() of R base.\n\n\nFirst, we will build a simple linear regression model by using SELLING_PRICE as the dependent variable and AREA_SQM as the independent variable.\n\ncondo.slr &lt;- lm(formula=SELLING_PRICE ~ AREA_SQM, data = condo_resale.sf)\n\nlm() returns an object of class “lm” or for multiple responses of class c(“mlm”, “lm”).\nThe functions summary() and anova() can be used to obtain and print a summary and analysis of variance table of the results. The generic accessor functions coefficients, effects, fitted.values and residuals extract various useful features of the value returned by lm.\n\nsummary(condo.slr)\n\nThe output report reveals that the SELLING_PRICE can be explained by using the formula:\n      *y = -258121.1 + 14719x1*\nThe R-squared of 0.4518 reveals that the simple regression model built is able to explain about 45% of the resale prices.\nSince p-value is much smaller than 0.0001, we will reject the null hypothesis that mean is a good estimator of SELLING_PRICE. This will allow us to infer that simple linear regression model above is a good estimator of SELLING_PRICE.\nThe Coefficients: section of the report reveals that the p-values of both the estimates of the Intercept and ARA_SQM are smaller than 0.001. In view of this, the null hypothesis of the B0 and B1 are equal to 0 will be rejected. As a results, we will be able to infer that the B0 and B1 are good parameter estimates.\nTo visualise the best fit curve on a scatterplot, we can incorporate lm() as a method function in ggplot’s geometry as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nggplot(data=condo_resale.sf,  \n       aes(x=`AREA_SQM`, y=`SELLING_PRICE`)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = lm)\n\nFigure above reveals that there are a few statistical outliers with relatively high selling prices.\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore building a multiple regression model, it is important to ensure that the indepdent variables used are not highly correlated to each other. If these highly correlated independent variables are used in building a regression model by mistake, the quality of the model will be compromised. This phenomenon is known as multicollinearity in statistics.\nCorrelation matrix is commonly used to visualise the relationships between the independent variables. Beside the pairs() of R, there are many packages support the display of a correlation matrix. In this section, the corrplot package will be used.\nThe code chunk below is used to plot a scatterplot matrix of the relationship between the independent variables in condo_resale data.frame.\n\ncorrplot(cor(condo_resale[, 5:23]), diag = FALSE, order = \"AOE\",\n         tl.pos = \"td\", tl.cex = 0.5, method = \"number\", type = \"upper\")\n\nMatrix reorder is very important for mining the hiden structure and patter in the matrix. There are four methods in corrplot (parameter order), named “AOE”, “FPC”, “hclust”, “alphabet”. In the code chunk above, AOE order is used. It orders the variables by using the angular order of the eigenvectors method suggested by Michael Friendly.\nFrom the scatterplot matrix, it is clear that Freehold is highly correlated to LEASE_99YEAR. In view of this, it is wiser to only include either one of them in the subsequent model building. As a result, LEASE_99YEAR is excluded in the subsequent model building.\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below using lm() to calibrate the multiple linear regression model.\n\ncondo.mlr &lt;- lm(formula = SELLING_PRICE ~ AREA_SQM + AGE    + \n                  PROX_CBD + PROX_CHILDCARE + PROX_ELDERLYCARE +\n                  PROX_URA_GROWTH_AREA + PROX_HAWKER_MARKET + PROX_KINDERGARTEN + \n                  PROX_MRT  + PROX_PARK + PROX_PRIMARY_SCH + \n                  PROX_TOP_PRIMARY_SCH + PROX_SHOPPING_MALL + PROX_SUPERMARKET + \n                  PROX_BUS_STOP + NO_Of_UNITS + FAMILY_FRIENDLY + FREEHOLD, \n                data=condo_resale.sf)\nsummary(condo.mlr)\n\n\n\n\nWith reference to the report above, it is clear that not all the independent variables are statistically significant. We will revised the model by removing those variables which are not statistically significant.\nNow, we are ready to calibrate the revised model by using the code chunk below.\n\ncondo.mlr1 &lt;- lm(formula = SELLING_PRICE ~ AREA_SQM + AGE + \n                   PROX_CBD + PROX_CHILDCARE + PROX_ELDERLYCARE +\n                   PROX_URA_GROWTH_AREA + PROX_MRT  + PROX_PARK + \n                   PROX_PRIMARY_SCH + PROX_SHOPPING_MALL    + PROX_BUS_STOP + \n                   NO_Of_UNITS + FAMILY_FRIENDLY + FREEHOLD,\n                 data=condo_resale.sf)\nols_regress(condo.mlr1)\n\n\n\n\nThe gtsummary package provides an elegant and flexible way to create publication-ready summary tables in R.\nIn the code chunk below, tbl_regression() is used to create a well formatted regression report.\n\ntbl_regression(condo.mlr1, intercept = TRUE)1\n\nWith gtsummary package, model statistics can be included in the report by either appending them to the report table by using add_glance_table() or adding as a table source note by using add_glance_source_note() as shown in the code chunk below.\n\ntbl_regression(condo.mlr1, \n               intercept = TRUE) %&gt;% \n  add_glance_source_note(\n    label = list(sigma ~ \"\\U03C3\"),\n    include = c(r.squared, adj.r.squared, \n                AIC, statistic,\n                p.value, sigma))\n\nFor more customisation options, refer to Tutorial: tbl_regression\n\n\nIn this section, we would like to introduce you a fantastic R package specially programmed for performing OLS regression. It is called olsrr. It provides a collection of very useful methods for building better multiple linear regression models:\n\ncomprehensive regression output\nresidual diagnostics\nmeasures of influence\nheteroskedasticity tests\ncollinearity diagnostics\nmodel fit assessment\nvariable contribution assessment\nvariable selection procedures\n\nIn the code chunk below, the ols_vif_tol() of olsrr package is used to test if there are sign of multicollinearity.\n\nols_vif_tol(condo.mlr1)\n\nSince the VIF of the independent variables are less than 10. We can safely conclude that there are no sign of multicollinearity among the independent variables.\n\n\n\nIn multiple linear regression, it is important for us to test the assumption that linearity and additivity of the relationship between dependent and independent variables.\nIn the code chunk below, the ols_plot_resid_fit() of olsrr package is used to perform linearity assumption test.\n\nols_plot_resid_fit(condo.mlr1)\n\nThe figure above reveals that most of the data poitns are scattered around the 0 line, hence we can safely conclude that the relationships between the dependent variable and independent variables are linear.\n\n\n\nLastly, the code chunk below uses ols_plot_resid_hist() of olsrr package to perform normality assumption test.\n\nols_plot_resid_hist(condo.mlr1)\n\nThe figure reveals that the residual of the multiple linear regression model (i.e. condo.mlr1) is resemble normal distribution.\nIf you prefer formal statistical test methods, the ols_test_normality() of olsrr package can be used as shown in the code chun below.\n\nols_test_normality(condo.mlr1)\n\nThe summary table above reveals that the p-values of the four tests are way smaller than the alpha value of 0.05. Hence we will reject the null hypothesis and infer that there is statistical evidence that the residual are not normally distributed.\n\n\n\nThe hedonic model we try to build are using geographically referenced attributes, hence it is also important for us to visual the residual of the hedonic pricing model.\nIn order to perform spatial autocorrelation test, we need to convert condo_resale.sf from sf data frame into a SpatialPointsDataFrame.\nFirst, we will export the residual of the hedonic pricing model and save it as a data frame.\n\nmlr.output &lt;- as.data.frame(condo.mlr1$residuals)\n\nNext, we will join the newly created data frame with condo_resale.sf object.\n\ncondo_resale.res.sf &lt;- cbind(condo_resale.sf, \n                        condo.mlr1$residuals) %&gt;%\nrename(`MLR_RES` = `condo.mlr1.residuals`)\n\nNext, we will convert condo_resale.res.sf from simple feature object into a SpatialPointsDataFrame because spdep package can only process sp conformed spatial data objects.\nThe code chunk below will be used to perform the data conversion process.\n\ncondo_resale.sp &lt;- as_Spatial(condo_resale.res.sf)\ncondo_resale.sp\n\nNext, we will use tmap package to display the distribution of the residuals on an interactive map.\nThe code churn below will turn on the interactive mode of tmap.\n\ntmap_mode(\"view\")\n\nThe code chunks below is used to create an interactive point symbol map.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_svy21)+\n  tmap_options(check.and.fix = TRUE) +\n  tm_polygons(alpha = 0.4) +\ntm_shape(condo_resale.res.sf) +  \n  tm_dots(col = \"MLR_RES\",\n          alpha = 0.6,\n          style=\"quantile\") +\n  tm_view(set.zoom.limits = c(11,14))\n\nRemember to switch back to “plot” mode before continue.\n\ntmap_mode(\"plot\")\n\nThe figure above reveal that there is sign of spatial autocorrelation.\nTo proof that our observation is indeed true, the Moran’s I test will be performed\nFirst, we will compute the distance-based weight matrix by using dnearneigh() function of spdep.\n\nnb &lt;- dnearneigh(coordinates(condo_resale.sp), 0, 1500, longlat = FALSE)\nsummary(nb)\n\nNext, nb2listw() of spdep packge will be used to convert the output neighbours lists (i.e. nb) into a spatial weights.\n\nnb_lw &lt;- nb2listw(nb, style = 'W')\nsummary(nb_lw)\n\nNext, lm.morantest() of spdep package will be used to perform Moran’s I test for residual spatial autocorrelation\n\nlm.morantest(condo.mlr1, nb_lw)\n\nThe Global Moran’s I test for residual spatial autocorrelation shows that it’s p-value is less than 0.00000000000000022 which is less than the alpha value of 0.05. Hence, we will reject the null hypothesis that the residuals are randomly distributed.\nSince the Observed Global Moran I = 0.1424418 which is greater than 0, we can infer than the residuals resemble cluster distribution."

    "text": "In this section, you are going to learn how to modelling hedonic pricing using both the fixed and adaptive bandwidth schemes\n\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below bw.gwr() of GWModel package is used to determine the optimal fixed bandwidth to use in the model. Notice that the argument adaptive is set to FALSE indicates that we are interested to compute the fixed bandwidth.\nThere are two possible approaches can be uused to determine the stopping rule, they are: CV cross-validation approach and AIC corrected (AICc) approach. We define the stopping rule using approach argeement.\n\nbw.fixed &lt;- bw.gwr(formula = SELLING_PRICE ~ AREA_SQM + AGE + PROX_CBD + \n                     PROX_CHILDCARE + PROX_ELDERLYCARE  + PROX_URA_GROWTH_AREA + \n                     PROX_MRT   + PROX_PARK + PROX_PRIMARY_SCH + \n                     PROX_SHOPPING_MALL + PROX_BUS_STOP + NO_Of_UNITS + \n                     FAMILY_FRIENDLY + FREEHOLD, \n                   data=condo_resale.sp, \n                   approach=\"CV\", \n                   kernel=\"gaussian\", \n                   adaptive=FALSE, \n                   longlat=FALSE)\n\nThe result shows that the recommended bandwidth is 971.3405 metres.\nQuiz: Do you know why it is in metre?\nThe bandwidth in this case is measured in meters because the longlat=FALSE argument was set in the spatial analysis function.\nBy default, many spatial libraries use geographic coordinates (longitude and latitude) when longlat=TRUE, meaning that distances are interpreted in angular units (degrees). However, when longlat=FALSE, the analysis assumes a projected coordinate system where distances are measured in linear units like meters or kilometers, which is common for accurate spatial distance measurements in GIS.\nIn other words, the analysis is performed in a projected coordinate system, such as UTM where the units are in meters. This is essential for accurate distance-based calculations, like kernel density estimation, which would be incorrect if the distances were interpreted in degrees.\nSo, the bandwidth is in meters because the spatial data has been projected into a system that uses meters as the unit of measurement.\n\n\n\nNow we can use the code chunk below to calibrate the gwr model using fixed bandwidth and gaussian kernel.\n\ngwr.fixed &lt;- gwr.basic(formula = SELLING_PRICE ~ AREA_SQM + AGE + PROX_CBD + \n                         PROX_CHILDCARE + PROX_ELDERLYCARE  + PROX_URA_GROWTH_AREA + \n                         PROX_MRT   + PROX_PARK + PROX_PRIMARY_SCH + \n                         PROX_SHOPPING_MALL + PROX_BUS_STOP + NO_Of_UNITS + \n                         FAMILY_FRIENDLY + FREEHOLD, \n                       data=condo_resale.sp, \n                       bw=bw.fixed, \n                       kernel = 'gaussian', \n                       longlat = FALSE)\n\nThe output is saved in a list of class “gwrm”. The code below can be used to display the model output.\n\ngwr.fixed\n\nThe report shows that the AICc of the gwr is 42263.61 which is significantly smaller than the globel multiple linear regression model of 42967.1.\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, we will calibrate the gwr-based hedonic pricing model by using adaptive bandwidth approach.\n\n\nSimilar to the earlier section, we will first use bw.gwr() to determine the recommended data point to use.\nThe code chunk used look very similar to the one used to compute the fixed bandwidth except the adaptive argument has changed to TRUE.\n\nbw.adaptive &lt;- bw.gwr(formula = SELLING_PRICE ~ AREA_SQM + AGE  + \n                        PROX_CBD + PROX_CHILDCARE + PROX_ELDERLYCARE    + \n                        PROX_URA_GROWTH_AREA + PROX_MRT + PROX_PARK + \n                        PROX_PRIMARY_SCH + PROX_SHOPPING_MALL   + PROX_BUS_STOP + \n                        NO_Of_UNITS + FAMILY_FRIENDLY + FREEHOLD, \n                      data=condo_resale.sp, \n                      approach=\"CV\", \n                      kernel=\"gaussian\", \n                      adaptive=TRUE, \n                      longlat=FALSE)\n\nThe result shows that the 30 is the recommended data points to be used.\n\n\n\nNow, we can go ahead to calibrate the gwr-based hedonic pricing model by using adaptive bandwidth and gaussian kernel as shown in the code chunk below.\n\ngwr.adaptive &lt;- gwr.basic(formula = SELLING_PRICE ~ AREA_SQM + AGE + \n                            PROX_CBD + PROX_CHILDCARE + PROX_ELDERLYCARE + \n                            PROX_URA_GROWTH_AREA + PROX_MRT + PROX_PARK + \n                            PROX_PRIMARY_SCH + PROX_SHOPPING_MALL + PROX_BUS_STOP + \n                            NO_Of_UNITS + FAMILY_FRIENDLY + FREEHOLD, \n                          data=condo_resale.sp, bw=bw.adaptive, \n                          kernel = 'gaussian', \n                          adaptive=TRUE, \n                          longlat = FALSE)\n\nThe code below can be used to display the model output.\n\ngwr.adaptive\n\nThe report shows that the AICc the adaptive distance gwr is 41982.22 which is even smaller than the AICc of the fixed distance gwr of 42263.61.\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to regression residuals, the output feature class table includes fields for observed and predicted y values, condition number (cond), Local R2, residuals, and explanatory variable coefficients and standard errors:\n\nCondition Number: this diagnostic evaluates local collinearity. In the presence of strong local collinearity, results become unstable. Results associated with condition numbers larger than 30, may be unreliable.\nLocal R2: these values range between 0.0 and 1.0 and indicate how well the local regression model fits observed y values. Very low values indicate the local model is performing poorly. Mapping the Local R2 values to see where GWR predicts well and where it predicts poorly may provide clues about important variables that may be missing from the regression model.\nPredicted: these are the estimated (or fitted) y values 3. computed by GWR.\nResiduals: to obtain the residual values, the fitted y values are subtracted from the observed y values. Standardized residuals have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of 1. A cold-to-hot rendered map of standardized residuals can be produce by using these values.\nCoefficient Standard Error: these values measure the reliability of each coefficient estimate. Confidence in those estimates are higher when standard errors are small in relation to the actual coefficient values. Large standard errors may indicate problems with local collinearity.\n\nThey are all stored in a SpatialPointsDataFrame or SpatialPolygonsDataFrame object integrated with fit.points, GWR coefficient estimates, y value, predicted values, coefficient standard errors and t-values in its “data” slot in an object called SDF of the output list.\n\n\n\nTo visualise the fields in SDF, we need to first covert it into sf data.frame by using the code chunk below.\n\ncondo_resale.sf.adaptive &lt;- st_as_sf(gwr.adaptive$SDF) %&gt;%\n  st_transform(crs=3414)\n\n\ncondo_resale.sf.adaptive.svy21 &lt;- st_transform(condo_resale.sf.adaptive, 3414)\ncondo_resale.sf.adaptive.svy21  \n\n\ngwr.adaptive.output &lt;- as.data.frame(gwr.adaptive$SDF)\ncondo_resale.sf.adaptive &lt;- cbind(condo_resale.res.sf, as.matrix(gwr.adaptive.output))\n\nNext, glimpse() is used to display the content of condo_resale.sf.adaptive sf data frame.\n\nglimpse(condo_resale.sf.adaptive)\n\n\nsummary(gwr.adaptive$SDF$yhat)\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunks below is used to create an interactive point symbol map.\n\ntmap_mode(\"view\")\ntm_shape(mpsz_svy21)+\n  tm_polygons(alpha = 0.1) +\ntm_shape(condo_resale.sf.adaptive) +  \n  tm_dots(col = \"Local_R2\",\n          border.col = \"gray60\",\n          border.lwd = 1) +\n  tm_view(set.zoom.limits = c(11,14))\n\nSet back to plotting mode\n\ntmap_mode(\"plot\")\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunks below is used to create an interactive point symbol map.\n\ntmap_mode(\"view\")\nAREA_SQM_SE &lt;- tm_shape(mpsz_svy21)+\n  tm_polygons(alpha = 0.1) +\ntm_shape(condo_resale.sf.adaptive) +  \n  tm_dots(col = \"AREA_SQM_SE\",\n          border.col = \"gray60\",\n          border.lwd = 1) +\n  tm_view(set.zoom.limits = c(11,14))\n\nAREA_SQM_TV &lt;- tm_shape(mpsz_svy21)+\n  tm_polygons(alpha = 0.1) +\ntm_shape(condo_resale.sf.adaptive) +  \n  tm_dots(col = \"AREA_SQM_TV\",\n          border.col = \"gray60\",\n          border.lwd = 1) +\n  tm_view(set.zoom.limits = c(11,14))\n\ntmap_arrange(AREA_SQM_SE, AREA_SQM_TV, \n             asp=1, ncol=2,\n             sync = TRUE)\n\nSet back to plotting mode\n\ntmap_mode(\"plot\")\n\n\n\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_svy21[mpsz_svy21$REGION_N==\"CENTRAL REGION\", ])+\n  tm_polygons()+\ntm_shape(condo_resale.sf.adaptive) + \n  tm_bubbles(col = \"Local_R2\",\n           size = 0.15,\n           border.col = \"gray60\",\n           border.lwd = 1)"
